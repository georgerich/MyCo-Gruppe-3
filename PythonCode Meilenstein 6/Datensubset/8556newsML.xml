<p>English county side Sussex said on Thursday they would not re-register fast bowler Ed Giddins after he has served his 19-month ban for using cocaine.</p>
<p>Giddins, who joined Sussex in 1991, was barred on Tuesday from playing first-class cricket until April 1, 1998.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe it to be important that a message is received loud and clear that the use of drugs in any walk of life, but particularly in sport, is wrong and will not be tolerated,&quot; Sussex secretary Nigel Bett said.</p>
<p>&quot;The committee debated the matter at length and came to the conclusion that it would be in the best interests of the club and the player if a clean break was made.&quot;</p>
<p>Giddins, who toured Pakistan with England A last winter, tested positive after a county match against Kent in May. A second test also proved positive.</p>
