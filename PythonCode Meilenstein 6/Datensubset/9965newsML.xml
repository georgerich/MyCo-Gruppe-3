<p>Australian Resources Ltd said on Thursday that it expects to spend about A$15 million on exploration for copper and gold in 1996/1997, mainly in Queensland and Western Australia.</p>
<p>This compares with A$13.5 million in 1995/96, managing director Richard Windsor told Reuters.</p>
<p>Windsor said the focus would be on new finds outside the company's Selywyn copper/gold mine in Queensland and the Gidgee and Mount Mclure gold mines in Western Australia.  </p>
<p>&quot;Instead of spending virtually all of our money around the three operating mines we are going into more grassroots or advanced exploration projects outside the mine areas,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Higher depreciation and amortisation charges contributed to six percent decline in the company's 1995/96 net profit to A$15.5 million, reported earlier on Thursday, Windsor said.</p>
<p>Weighted average cash operating cost for gold production increased to A$267 an ounce in 1996/97 compared with A$260.00 an ounce in the previous year, the company said.</p>
<p>For the latest year, the company said it produced 200,764 ounces of gold, up marginally from 198,184 the previous year.  </p>
<p>Australian Resources previously has said the Gidgee mine incurred high production costs in the second half, which would weigh on 1995/96 profits.</p>
<p>At 12.45 p.m. (0245 GMT), Australian Resources shares were trading two cents higher at A$0.87.</p>
