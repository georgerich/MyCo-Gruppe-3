<p>Israeli intelligence agencies are increasingly concerned that Syria may opt for war to break a deadlock in peace talks, a senior legislator said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Hagai Merom of the opposition Labour party told Israel Radio he planned to ask for an urgent special session of parliament to discuss what he called a &quot;grave and worrisome&quot; situation.</p>
<p>In an apparent sign of U.S. concern, Ambassador Martin Indyk held talks with Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy.</p>
<p>Israel Radio said Levy asked Indyk that the United States convey a message to Syria that &quot;Israel is interested in calm and in advancing the peace process&quot;. A ministry spokesman confirmed the meeting took place but gave no details of the discussion.</p>
<p>Merom, chairman of parliament's Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee under the last Labour-led government, said he could not accept Likud Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's attempts to play down recent tensions with Syria.</p>
<p>&quot;I have heard recently that all Israeli intelligence elements are very carefully examining Syria through a magnifying glass and listening to every noise sounded there,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;From the way things look and sound, the possibility that a war option is being considered (by Syria) as realistic has deepened.&quot;</p>
<p>In an interview with Israeli Army Radio, Merom said: &quot;Assessments are growing within Military Intelligence that there is a possibility of war with Syria.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We must not wake up one morning to a new Yom Kippur,&quot; Merom said, referring to the surprise Egyptian and Syrian attacks that launched the 1973 Middle East war on the Jewish Day of Atonement.</p>
<p>Tension has mounted between Israel and Syria since Netanyahu took office in June vowing to retain the occupied Golan Heights. Israeli-Syrian peace talks have been deadlocked over the Golan issue since 1991.</p>
<p>Netanyahu's predecessor Shimon Peres, while giving no firm commitment to quit all of the Golan, said he could not envisage Syria making peace without regaining the territory.</p>
<p>&quot;We must open our eyes. This diplomatic deadlock is very dangerous. Syria and Iran already have a new approach and Iran has taken a much more central role than when the Labour government was pushing the peace process forward,&quot; Merom said.</p>
<p>Syria's Prime Minister Mahmoud Zu'bi ended on Tuesday a four-day visit to Iran during which he met President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, who said the two countries must strengthen ties to face the United States and Israel.</p>
<p>Syria accused Israel on Wednesday of launching a hysterical campaign against it after Israeli Channel Two television reported on Monday that Damascus had recently test fired a Scud C missile able to hit most cities in the Jewish state.</p>
<p>Israel on Tuesday tested its U.S.-funded Arrow 2 missile, saying it successfully intercepted a target missile.</p>
<p>Netanyahu said Syria had been arming itself for years with Scuds and there was no change in the strategic balance, which military analysts consider to be in Israel's favour.</p>
<p>&quot;I view with gravity the attempts of officials in the opposition to create a campaign of fear as if Israel is in some sort of immediate, terrible danger -- as if something has changed in some sweeping way,&quot; Netanyahu said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Syria on Tuesday accused Israel of beating the drums of war in the Middle East and warned Netanyahu that he would be defeated in any military confrontation with Arabs.</p>
<p>&quot;Israel is no longer interested in making peace. It has retracted from all its peace process commitments and guarantees and returned to its traditional course of escalating tension, beating the drums of war and waving flagrant threats against Syria and Lebanon,&quot; the ruling party newspaper al-Baath said.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no doubt that Israel, after killing the peace process, will try to set off new wars in the region and exert pressures on Arabs who have rejected its plans,&quot; it said.</p>
