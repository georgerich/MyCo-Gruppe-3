<p>Polar Air Cargo said there is likely to be an increase in Hong Kong to U.S. air cargo rates in September to coincide with the start of the market's peak season on the route.</p>
<p>The carrier's Hong Kong sales manager, David Sung told Reuters in an interview that there was an increase of five to seven percent in sale volumes during July, signalling the approach of the peak season.</p>
<p>&quot;Volume has increased to such an extent that it should now warrant the start of peak season pricing from September the first. The market is much stronger than last year when there was no peak season because of over capacity. Now there is less capacity and around five per cent more business so demand for space will be much more than last year,&quot; Sung said.</p>
<p>He added that Polar Air is about to launch a premium rate express service from Hong Kong to the U.S. east coast at the same time.</p>
<p>Sung said he thinks there is a growing demand for a such a service for 'must go' cargo. Polar Air offers a trans-Pacific service from Hong Kong to either Columbus, Ohio or Chicago five times a week using Boeing 747's with 95 tons cargo capacity.</p>
<p>However, in common with other cargo airlines, Sung said yields remain disappointing.</p>
<p>He added the new express service will help customers who must have same day dispatch at a competitive price. He declined to reveal pricing policy.</p>
<p>&quot;We're capable of starting this guaranteed uplift and same day arrival on a &quot;must go&quot; basis and I think with the peak season there will be some carriers who don't have enough capacity and we can meet the customer's need,&quot; he said.
