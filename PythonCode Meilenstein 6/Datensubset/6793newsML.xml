<p>An Israeli military court jailed a Palestinian for 22 years on Wednesday for his part in the 1994 kidnapping of Israeli soldier Nachshon Waxman, Israel Radio said.</p>
<p>The court in the central Israeli town of Lod convicted Zakariya Lutfi Najib, 40, of providing support to the Islamic militants who abducted the 19-year-old soldier, a dual U.S.-Israeli citizen.</p>
<p>The radio said Najib had rented a house in the occupied West Bank where the kidnappers held Waxman and brought them food.</p>
<p>Members of the Islamic Hamas group dressed as religious Jews snatched Waxman from a soldiers' hitchhiking station in October 1994, took him to the hideout and demanded Israel free hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in exchange for his release.</p>
<p>Waxman was killed when Israeli soldiers stormed the hideout days after the kidnapping in a failed rescue attempt. Three of the kidnappers and another Israeli soldier were also killed in the raid.</p>
<p>Najib's lawyer said he would appeal against what he described as a severe sentence.</p>
