<headline>FOCUS - U.S. goods data weighs on European stocks.</headline>

<p>London shares powered to a new peak on Friday before unexpectedly strong U.S. economic data sent U.S. and European stocks into retreat.</p>
<p>Surprisingly strong U.S. durable goods figures weighed heavily on Wall Street at the opening and pushed U.S. Treasury bonds down as well.</p>
<p>Wall Street's strong overnight performance had been a major influence on London shares, along with hopes that an interest rate cut by the German Bundesbank on Thursday could pave the way for British rates to be shaved again, too.</p>
<p>London's blue-chip FTSE 100 index rose to a record of 3,911 points but later drifted back to around the key 3,900 level.</p>
<p>German and French shares were mixed, while the dollar continued to lose ground after a push higher sparked by the German rate cut fizzled out.</p>
<p>The dollar's fall below 1.49 marks in Europe followed fresh assessments of the likely direction of interest rates following the Bundesbank's move.</p>
<p>&quot;The sentiment is that this will be the last German cut, which has left a bit of a vacuum today as people decide which way to position themselves,&quot; one German bank dealer said.</p>
<p>Late in European trading, the dollar was stuck in a tight range at 1.4875 marks and 108.53 yen, compared with 1.4935 and 108.43 at the London close on Thursday.</p>
<p>With a long weekend coming up in Britain, dealers said the equity market remained cautious despite the FTSE breaching a psychological level at 3,900 points.</p>
<p>&quot;Prices were marked back on the (U.S.) durable goods figures but there isn't any selling. I still think there are short positions out there. People are trying to square away their books before the long weekend,&quot; one senior trader said.</p>
<p>Wall Street opened soft, pressured by Treasuries, but by 1400 GMT the Dow Jones index had recovered much of its early loss to trade around three points down.</p>
<p>London dealers said they expected the market to consolidate its recent gains although the underlying tone remained firm, backed by encouraging corporate earnings and an improved interest rate environment.</p>
<p>French shares extended their losses after the U.S. data but climbed back after hitting resistance at around 2,009 on the CAC-40 share index and had just pushed into positive territory by 1400 GMT.</p>
<p>Paris stocks were hurt earlier on by profit-taking following big gains on Thursday.</p>
<p>German equities ended a dull bourse session almost unchanged from closing levels on Thursday as the weaker dollar and softer bonds weighed on sentiment.</p>
<p>At the end of bourse trade, Frankfurt's DAX index was down 2.10 points, or 0.08 percent, at 2,555.16. Following the U.S. economic figures, the IBIS DAX index that tracks screen-based share trading was down 2.17 points to 2,557.25.</p>
<p>Chemical shares were among the main winners on the DAX over the bourse session, especially BASF, which ended up 47 pfennigs at 43.60 marks after reporting a 14.7 percent rise in first-half profits on Thursday.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1400 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was at 1.4875 marks and 108.53 yen, compared with 1.4935 and 108.43 at the London close on Thursday.</p>
<p>STOCK MARKETS AT 1400 GMT</p>
<p>LONDON - The FTSE 100 index was up 9.0 at 3,900.1.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT - The 30-share DAX index closed floor trade down 2.10 points, or 0.08 percent, at 2,555.16 points. The IBIS DAX index that tracks screen-based share trading was down 2.17 points to 2,557.25.</p>
<p>PARIS - The CAC-40 index was up 1.40 points at 2,019.16.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold fixed unchanged from the morning at $387.50 an ounce vs $387.00 on Thursday afternoon. Silver was up one cent at $5.24.</p>
