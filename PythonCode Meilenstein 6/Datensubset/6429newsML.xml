<p>Rodney King, the black motorist whose videotaped beating by white police officers ultimately led to the 1992 Los Angeles riots, was sentenced Wednesday to 90 days in jail for hit-and-run driving.</p>
<p>King, 31, was allowed to remain free on bail while appealing his misdemeanor conviction, which stemmed from a fight he had with his estranged wife in July 1995.</p>
<p>Passing sentence, Municipal Court Judge Michael Kanner called King's actions &quot;reprehensible&quot; and accused him of leaving his wife &quot;flopping around in the street like a sack of potatoes.&quot;</p>
<p>Prosecutors alleged during King's trial that his wife, Crystal, got out of their car during an argument and that when she reached back through the passenger window for her purse, King drove off, dragging her and sending her tumbling to the ground.</p>
<p>A jury last month found King guilty on one count of hit-and-run driving -- fleeing the scene of an accident -- but acquitted him of the more serious charges of spousal abuse and assault with a deadly weapon.</p>
<p>The judge sentenced King on Wednesday to 90 days in the Los Angeles County Jail, placed him on two years' probation, fined him $100 and ordered him to pay his wife's medical bills.</p>
<p>King showed no emotion when the sentence was read, but outside court he told reporters: &quot;It's not over yet. It just sounds funny when a guy is a victim of his wife. No one wants to believe him. I've got a bear for a woman.&quot;</p>
<p>During the sentencing hearing in the Los Angeles suburb of Alhambra, King's defence attorney, Edi Faal, told the judge King's wife had been &quot;acting recklessly&quot; and was to blame for her own injuries. He said King did not deserve jail time and should instead be fined no more than $1,000.</p>
<p>But prosecutor Donna Wills had asked that King receive the maximum penalty of one year in jail and a $5,000 fine because he had shown no remorse. &quot;He laughed or made a sarcastic grin as he left the scene (of the crime),&quot; she told the judge.</p>
<p>Crystal King, who injured her arm and suffered a head wound that required stitches, testified reluctantly against her husband during his trial.</p>
<p>King first entered the public spotlight in March 1991, when white police officers were captured on videotape beating and kicking him after a high-speed chase. The April 1992 state court acquittals of four officers touched off rioting in Los Angeles that left more than 50 people dead and caused an estimated $1 billion in damage.</p>
<p>Two of the officers were convicted in federal court in 1994 of violating King's civil rights and served 30-month prison sentences. A federal jury later awarded King $3.8 million in damages for his injuries.</p>
