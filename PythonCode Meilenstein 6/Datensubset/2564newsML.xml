<p>Italian shares rebounded from Monday's losses on Tuesday in a largely technical reaction, but also helped by official data showing that inflationary pressures were less than analysts had anticipated during June.</p>
<p>Stocks edged higher this morning in continued thin holiday trading and then were supported by a touch firmer Wall Street, but many investors had eyes only for today's U.S. FOMC meeting, although most expect no rise in U.S. interest rates.</p>
<p>The all-share Mibtel index ended up 0.5 percent at 9,593 and the blue chip Mib30 index 0.56 percent higher at 14,329, after they lost 1.16 percent and 1.36 percent on Monday.</p>
<p>Shares dipped Monday after the hard-left Communists said Romano Prodi's centre-left government had only a 50 percent chance of surviving this autumn, but today better than expected inflation data gave support to stocks, dealers said.</p>
<p>Italian June annual producer prices rose 0.6 percent after May's 1.3 percent, while June annual wholesale inflation increased 2.4 percent in June against 3.5 percent in May. Both June figures were below market expectations.</p>
<p>Market focus is now likely to be on Italian preliminary August consumer price inflation, with six cities reporting on Wednesday and the remaining four on Thursday.</p>
<p>Dealers said activity will continue to be subdued due to political uncertainty over the Communist Refoundation Party, who's support the government has relied upon in the lower house, and with many market players still on holiday.</p>
<p>Most blue chips moved forward in quiet holiday trading with ENI up 0.16 percent at 6,690 lire after it said it had sold five percent of oilfield service arm Saipem to bring ENI's stake down to 75 percent. Montedison was up 1.45 percent at 995 lire.</p>
<p>Pirelli shares rose 1.79 percent to 2,500 lire after it and Michelin tied for best overall passenger tyres in a U.S. consumer survey by market research firm J.D. Power.</p>
