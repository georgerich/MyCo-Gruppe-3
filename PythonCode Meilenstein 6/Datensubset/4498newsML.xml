<p>New Zealand share prices ended steady but off their peak on Tuesday on moderate turnover, the market reacting little to the Government's sale of Forestry Corp of New Zealand to a New Zealand-Chinese consortium.</p>
<p>The NZSE-40 Capital Index ended 0.54 of a point higher at 2,167.79 on turnover worth NZ$40 million.</p>
<p>The Government earlier said that it had sold FCNZ to a consortium comprising Fletcher Challenge, Brierley Investments and China's Citifor for NZ$2.026 billion.  </p>
<p>Most leaders were slightly firmer, the exception being Carter Holt Harvey, which lost five cents to NZ$3.15 after a disappointing first quarter result.</p>
<p>CHH said earlier its first quarter profit was NZ$56 million, down sharply from $155 million a year earlier.</p>
<p>&quot;I suspect that result is going to disappoint a few people,&quot; Luke Koekoek at JB Were said.</p>
<p>Although CHH missed out on the purchase of FCNZ, it may prove a mild positive that the price was above expectations, which may rub off on CHH's own forestry valuations.  </p>
<p>Koekoek said it had been a volatile session, the market moving down initially with CHH then recovering.</p>
<p>&quot;There are still a lot of players on the sideline at the moment,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Australia's budget, due on Tuesday night, may have an impact on Wednesday's opening, particularly if it influences the New Zealand dollar and local rates.</p>
<p>Progressive Enterprises was actively traded -- 5.20 million shares, worth NZ$5.99 million traded. The stock gained one cent to NZ$1.20. -- James Gray (64 9 302 1253)</p>
