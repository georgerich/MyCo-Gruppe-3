<p>ARA fuel oil bunkers prices were driven higher by plays in the barge market in the morning, but settled down from the highs, and business was fair.</p>
<p>Rotterdam 380 cst fuel oil rose to $102/$103 fob as two players bought barges aggressively. The highest traded level was $102 fob. Dealers said traded volume reached about 10,000 tonnes, a healthy volume some attributed to a three-day weekend in the U.K.</p>
<p>&quot;There won't be so many people on the barge market on Monday, so people are a bit worried the prices will be forced even higher,&quot; one dealer said.  </p>
<p>Hamburg prices followed those in Rotterdam. Prices rose in the afternoon to $105 fob. Supply remained good, leaving prices only $2/$3 above Rotterdam levels .</p>
<p>The Mediterranean's response to price rises in northern Europe was sluggish. French and Italian prices were up around $1 a tonne by the close. Spain was little changed. Business was very slack.</p>
<p>Durban's steady climb continued. Fuel oil 180 cst was up another $1 at $104/$106 fob.</p>
