<p>A fresh outbreak of fighting between northern Iraq's fractious Kurds on Friday threatened a U.S.-led peace plan to unite the mountainous region against President Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p>A Kurdish guerrilla group said it had inflicted &quot;a major defeat&quot; on a rival militia after almost a week of clashes that has shattered a ceasefire brokered last year by Washington.</p>
<p>The Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) of Massoud Barzani said on Thursday night it had repelled an attack by thousands of Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) fighters -- killing, wounding or capturing about 400 opposing guerrillas.</p>
<p>&quot;The PUK force were defeated and chased all the way to the Iranian border,&quot; the KDP said in a statement. The PUK, led by veteran warlord Jalal Talabani, was not available for comment.</p>
<p>The fighting has dashed the latest U.S. efforts to set up a workable Kurdish entity outside Baghdad's sphere of influence and has raised the spectre of greater Iranian involvement in the area.</p>
<p>&quot;The West has put quite a lot into putting the peace process together and it doesn't look too clever when it is stalled and then collapses,&quot; a NATO member diplomat said.</p>
<p>The Kurds agreed early last year to end more than a year of clashes that cost around 3,000 lives. But a full peace deal, agreed to at U.S.-sponsored talks in Ireland, is in limbo.</p>
<p>The militias have failed to implement an accord to share revenues from the KDP's makeshift oil trade on the Turkish border and demilitarise the PUK-held main city of Arbil.</p>
<p>Bad blood between Iraq's Kurds goes back to the mid-1960s when Talabani broke with the KDP. Western experts say he later sided with Iraqi government troops against his fellow Kurds.</p>
<p>The KDP has accused Talabani's forces of receiving military support from Iran in the current fighting. The PUK denies this and charges that Barzani's group is collaborating with Baghdad.</p>
<p>Possible Iranian backing for either of the Kurd groups worries the West as much, if not more, than its own loss of prestige in northern Iraq.</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone has been told to keep away from the Iranians,&quot; said KDP Ankara representative Safeen Dizayee.</p>
<p>A State Department spokesman in Washington, which accuses Iran of sponsoring international terrorism, said earlier this week that the fighting could &quot;create opportunities for outside players whose agendas have nothing to do with the best interests of the citizens of northern Iraq.&quot; He was referring to Tehran.</p>
<p>Several thousand Iranian troops briefly entered northern Iraq last month and killed about 20 Iranian Kurdish guerrillas based there.</p>
<p>&quot;If Iran is not directly involved this time then it is certainly trying to increase its influence,&quot; the Western diplomat said.</p>
<p>U.S., British and French planes have been patrolling the skies of northern Iraq since shortly after the 1991 Gulf War to shield Iraq's Kurds from any attack by Iraqi troops.</p>
<p>The air force is part of a concerted U.S.-led effort, backed by tough economic sanctions, to keep the pressure on Saddam's rule.</p>
