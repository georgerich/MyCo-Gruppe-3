<title>UK: NWE fuel oil barges show strong gains, cargoes lag.</title>
<headline>NWE fuel oil barges show strong gains, cargoes lag.</headline>

<p>High sulphur barges were again the centre of fuel oil attention on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Barges gained $2 from Monday's close to trade as high as $99 fob ARA. One major was an active buyer and 15-20,000 tonnes of product was done.</p>
<p>The firmer prices were attributed to crude oil's strength, strong paper prices and the buying interest. Busier physical bunker enquiries of about 15,000 tonnes was also supportive.</p>
<p>The high sulphur cracked cargo market continued to suffer from illiquidity. A trader that had been bidding in the high $90s cif NWE has withdrawn without securing a cargo.</p>
<p>Dealers said prices were in the low $90s cif NWE, but said exact levels were hard to gauge. &quot;We need a deal to give direction,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>Portuguese utility EdP has issued an additional tender to buy one 30,000 tonne cargo of high sulphur material for delivery at the end of August. The tender is in addition to the six cargoes it awarded for August supplies.</p>
<p>Low sulphur cracked fuel continued to be buffeted by the lack of buying interest by the main Med buyer. Prices in NWE failed to edge past $100 fob NWE.</p>
