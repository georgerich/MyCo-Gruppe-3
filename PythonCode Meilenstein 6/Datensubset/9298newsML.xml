<p>Argentine stocks were expected to slip further into negative territory at the opening Thursday but may find support later in the session, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is facing a lot of pressure from Congress, which seems in no hurry to pass fiscal reforms. However things are probably not as bleak as they seem,&quot; said Norman Trabucco at traders Zaracan. &quot;We should expect a rebound soon.&quot;</p>
<p>The blue-chip MerVal  index dived more than 5.0 percent between Tuesday and Wednesday, rattled by talk Congress may not pass the fiscal package until early October.  </p>
<p>Traders noted any congressional opposition to the reforms drafted by Economy Minister Roque Fernandez would revive old political and economic worries and cast doubts on the new minister's clout vis-a-vis his predecessor, Domingo Cavallo.</p>
<p>But while approval of the tax hikes and other measures was considered essential to plug Argentina's fiscal gap, there was also a sense the government only touched the surface.</p>
<p>&quot;The main problem with the package is it aims to squeeze more money out of the usual taxpayers, and does not battle chronic problems of corruption, evasion and overspending,&quot; said Trabucco.  </p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps the news that will help the markets snap their losing streak will come from the IMF,&quot; he added, referring to ongoing talks with an International Monetary Fund delegation.</p>
<p>Argentina overshot first-half fiscal targets by $1.0 billion and Fernandez has said the yearly deficit could more than double the original $2.5 billion goal agreed with the Fund if Congress does not pass his package.</p>
<p>The visiting IMF team is scheduled to meet Fernandez Friday.</p>
