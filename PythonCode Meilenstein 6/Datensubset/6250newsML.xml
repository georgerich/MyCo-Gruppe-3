<p>Singapore oil distillate prices fell on weaker crude, while fuel oil remained steady with trader buying interest seen, traders said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Traders said a MidEast trader who won the recent Thai fuel oil tender is expected to be pricing in his cargoes to Thailand until August 28 and will continue to place strong bids. Fuel oil 180-cst cargoes for September lifting were steady with bids/offers marginally lower at $102.50/$104.00 from Tuesday's $103/$105 but no deals were reported. The North Asia market however is soft, with a total of up to 200,000 tonnes from South Korea and Japan sufficient to meet demand from China.  </p>
<p>Gasoil prices fell in line with lower crude and a weaker swaps market. The fall was also attributed to increased availabilities from South Korea for September lifting due to reduced demand from South China. Traders said that China is not buying at the current high prices and are waiting for a downward price correction. Sources said Indonesia had already covered more than half its September gasoil needs. An offer was reported for 150,000 barrels lifting mid-September at $25.50 per barrel. Jet prices are coming under some pressure as consumers in North Asia are covering their winter demand directly from producers in the Middle East and Malaysia.  </p>
<p>The light distillates also edged down with crude. Gasoline was however more active than naphtha, with a Japanese trader heard selling 50,000 barrels pf 95-octane unleaded gasoline to a major at $21.40 a barrel for September 10-14 lifting, fob. An Australian refiner was also heard to have sold on Wednesday, an export cargo of 30,000 tonnes of 92-octane unleaded to a western trader at a discount to Singapore 92-octane quotes fob Australia but details were heard p+c. Traders said they expected Thai exports to amount to as much as 1.3 million barrels a month. The naphtha paper market was dull and September  was lower at $19.70/$19.90, compared to $19.85/$20.00 on Tuesday.--Singapore</p>
