<p>Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) on Tuesday reported first half 1996 pre-tax profits slightly up on the same period last year, but said the full-year result could be slightly weaker than the record profits of 1995.</p>
<p>SAS said first half pre-tax profits rose to 1.05 billion Swedish crowns ($159 million) from 1.04 billion during the same period last year. The result was slightly lower than market expectations.</p>
<p>The carrier, which is partially owned by the governments of Sweden, Norway and Denmark, said group operating revenue fell to 17.44 billion Swedish crowns ($2.6 billion) from 17.74 billion ($2.7 billion).</p>
<p>A statement said an earlier forecast of somewhat weaker full-year income before the sale of fixed assets compared with 1995 remained unchanged.</p>
<p>&quot;Last year was a record year,&quot; SAS Chief Executive Officer Jan Stenberg told reporters. &quot;We cannot all the time continue to beat new world records. Our profitability is very good compared to the rest of the European airline industry.&quot;</p>
<p>Full-year 1995 pre-tax profits were 2.63 billion Swedish crowns ($398 million).</p>
<p>Operating income in the second 1996 quarter fell mainly because a stronger Swedish crown had a negative effect on revenues in foreign currency not fully compensated for by positive effects on expenses in foreign currencies.</p>
<p>&quot;Part of the profit increase we would otherwise have seen we won't see because tickets sold in dollars and French franc are worth less in Swedish crowns,&quot; Stenberg said.</p>
<p>The Swedish crown has strengthened by six percent since the beginning of the year while the trend in the first half of 1995 was a weaking of eight percent.</p>
<p>After enjoying a virtual monopoly in Scandinavian skies for 50 years, SAS is now being challenged on its home base. Several airlines have recently moved into the skies traditionally dominated by SAS, undercutting its passenger prices which remain some of the highest in the world.</p>
<p>Virgin Express, run by Britain's high-flying entrepreneur Richard Branson, has announced the start of daily cheap flights between Copenhagen and Brussels from September. Norwegian airline Braathens SAFE has been given approval to run up to nine daily flights between Oslo and Stockholm from this autumn -- a route once tightly controlled by SAS.</p>
