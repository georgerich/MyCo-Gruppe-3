<p>Dolly, the tropical depression downgraded from a hurricane but expected to re-intensify to that status by Friday, inched into the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico on Wednesday as a new depression formed off the coast of west Africa, the National Hurricane Center said.</p>
<p>Once re-established as a hurricane, Dolly could eventually threaten the northern coast of Mexico, forecasters said.</p>
<p>&quot;She should start to pick up some speed and could become a hurricane again in about 48 hours,&quot; said forecaster Mike Hopkins. &quot;It may take a little longer that we first thought, but we believe it's going to happen.&quot;  </p>
<p>At 1700 EDT/2100 GMT, Dolly was located 50 miles (90 km) southwest of Campeche, or at latitude 19.4 north and longitude 91.1 west.</p>
<p>Dolly had maximum sustained winds of 35 mph (60 kmh) and was inching west at 3 mph (5 kmh), forecasters said.</p>
<p>Hurricane forecasters also announced the formation of a new tropical depression, the fifth of this Atlantic hurricane season.</p>
<p>The depression would be upgraded and named Tropical Storm Edouard when its maximum sustained winds top 39 mph (70 kmh), probably by Thursday afternoon, Hopkins said.</p>
<p>At 1700, the depression was located far from land, about 400 miles (700 km) west-southwest of the Cape Verde Islands. The storm was packing winds of 35 mph (60 kmh) and moving west at 13 mph (23 kmh).</p>
<p>Its exact position was latitude 13.0 north and longitude 29.5 west.</p>
