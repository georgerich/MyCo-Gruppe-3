<p>U.S. high-yield bonds were mostly unchanged at mid-session, although traders said new issuance and gaming sector trade punctuated the quietude.</p>
<p>Investment grade trade, meanwhile, was also lackluster ahead of an announcement on short-term rates by the Federal Open Market Committee. The tone was firm, however, and some selected spreads firmed by one or two basis points.</p>
<p>Back in junk trade, Haynes International Inc's $14O million bonds, priced to yield 12 percent on Tuesday, were quoted around the issue price after a Standard &amp; Poor's upgrade of the company's corporate credit rating.  </p>
<p>Standard &amp; Poor's raised the company's corporate credit rating to B-minus from CCC-plus, reflecting the fact that the refinancing will allow the company to repay its outstanding debt and avoid onerous near-term maturities.</p>
<p>The new Haynes debt, due in 2004, was given a 11.625 percent coupon and priced at 98.095 by lead manager Merrill Lynch &amp; Co Inc. S&amp;P assigned a B-minus rating to the issue. Moody's Investors Service rates the issue B3.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Sprint Spectrum LP set a total $523 million (proceeds) debt in two-tranches via lead managers Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers.</p>
