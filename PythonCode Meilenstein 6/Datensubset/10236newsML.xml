<p>Nigeria is taking a tough line with foreign oil companies it says are cheating it out of its rightful share of wealth.</p>
<p>Oil Minister Dan Etete told executives of the major companies in Lagos late on Thursday that rules would be strictly enforced to redress the perceived imbalance.</p>
<p>&quot;The government and people of Nigeria are not getting their fair share out of the joint venture arrangements for petroleum exploration and production,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Inequalities and anomalies which have almost made Nigeria the laughing stock of the international petroleum industry have to be eliminated.&quot;</p>
<p>Nigeria, Africa's most populous country, relies on the two million barrels of crude oil it pumps every day for about 95 percent of export earnings.</p>
<p>Etete said the joint ventures would have to set up escrow accounts, allowing the government to keep a closer eye on where contributions to production and exploration costs were going.</p>
<p>One company official said on Friday: &quot;We are still trying to work out what it really means. It may be a matter of rhetoric, or it may be that the minister has definite plans worked out.</p>
<p>An official at another company said: &quot;We already have extensive vetting...there is no need for any more. It would inevitably increase costs...It would hurt the joint ventures, in which Nigeria has the largest share.&quot;</p>
<p>State-run Nigerian National Petroleum Corp is majority partner in ventures with subsidiaries of Royal Dutch/Shell Group, Mobil Corp, Chevron Corp, Agip SpA and Elf Aquitaine.</p>
<p>To increase Nigerian participation in the industry, Etete said oil industry contracts would have to be handed out to locally registered companies. He bemoaned the loss of tax revenues to foreign-employed oil service companies.</p>
<p>Etete said that joint venture partners would have to recruit Nigerian staff wherever possible in preference to foreigners.</p>
<p>&quot;No wages shall be sanctioned in the case of any expatriate whose engagement did not meet with...prior approval,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Heavily indebted Nigeria has yet to emerge from an economic quagmire since a wave of strikes and protests in 1994, which followed the annulment of presidential elections in 1993 that would have ended 10 years of army rule.</p>
<p>Etete said the government planned to open up marginal fields inside the main oil companies' concessions and hand them over to those who are &quot;seriously interested in exploiting them&quot;.</p>
<p>Marginal fields are believed to hold reserves of 800 million barrels of a total Nigerian reserve above 21 billion barrels.</p>
<p>Delays in cash-call payments have often provoked the ire of the oil companies in the past, and this year government has cut by 30 percent its initial budget provision of $2 billion for oil operations, a decision challenged by the companies.</p>
<p>Negotiators for the two sides are trying to hammer out new rules for joint venture operations.</p>
<p>Analysts say budget cuts make it unlikely that Nigeria will reach its turn-of-the-century output capacity target of 2.5 million barrels a day. The government is under severe pressure from a $32 billion foreign debt to keep spending under control.</p>
