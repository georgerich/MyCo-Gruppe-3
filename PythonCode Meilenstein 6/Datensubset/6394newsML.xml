<p>CBOT soybean futures closed mostly higher on uncertainty about the fate of this year's U.S. soybean crop, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;It really was a pretty quiet session with late local short covering bringing it back (up),&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>Bullish input came from reports overnight from a U.S. crop tour indicating the Ohio and Indiana soybean crop showed diminished yield potential, especially in the event of an early or even normal frost. But traders expected better yield prospects in Illinois. &quot;There's strength out of the crop tour but it's back and forth,&quot; said Ron Kucha of O'Connor and Co.</p>
<p>The Professional Farmers of America tour group overnight heard from Indiana State Statistician Ralph Gann who said &quot;this is the latest planting season we've had since we started keeping records in 1951.&quot;</p>
<p>Nearby August soybeans traded in a relatively wide 22 cent per bushel range but expired quietly at 1201 at $8.17-1/4, down 6-3/4.</p>
<p>Other months ended 1-3/4 to 5-1/2 cents per bushel higher, with November up 2-3/4 at $7.79.</p>
<p>Estimated soybean futures volume was at 45,000 contracts, up from 43,507 Tuesday.</p>
<p>In the soybean options pit, Continental Grain bought 200 November $7.75 calls and sold 400 November $8.75 calls at 16 cents.</p>
<p>Soybean options volume was estimated at 20,000, down from 20,408 Tuesday.</p>
