<p>Police using batons and teargas stormed a Paris church on Friday and evicted 300 African migrants, including 10 on a 50-day-old hunger strike in protest against moves to expel them from France.</p>
<p>The Saint-Bernard church bells sounded the alarm as hundreds of helmeted police moved in, struggling with sympathisers including media celebrities who had surrounded it for several days to back the Africans' demand for residence papers.</p>
<p>Police broke down the church's main gate and burst through a barricade of chairs to remove the hunger strikers on stretchers.</p>
<p>The raid, greeted with an outcry on the Left and plaudits on the Right, came after Prime Minister Alain Juppe refused to grant the protesters blanket permission to stay in the country but promised to review their cases individually.</p>
<p>The protesters' spokeswoman Madjiguene Cisse said they were being taken to military hospitals in the Saint Mande and Clamart suburbs. Police said the other protesters were taken to a detention centre in the suburb of Vincennes.</p>
<p>Activists lay on the street in the path of police vans, vainly trying to stop them driving the protesters away.</p>
<p>The CFDT trade union at national airline Air France called on airport personnel to oppose police should they try to fly the immigrants home. Most are from Mali.</p>
<p>Chanting &quot;French people, immigrants, solidarity&quot;, activists kept confronting police for hours after the church was evacuated and called a protest march at 6 p.m. (1600 GMT). Police cordoned off the area in the heavily immigrant Goutte d'Or district, Juppe's former constituency.</p>
<p>Radio reports said some people had blood on their faces, but police said no-one had been injured.</p>
<p>Police said 40 people were being held and six would be prosecuted for assaulting police. Witnesses said film beauty Emanuelle Beart was taken to a police van but officials said she had requested to follow the protesters and was not detained.</p>
<p>She was among several celebrities who had vowed to chain themselves to the Africans to prevent police from removing them.</p>
<p>But she was outside the church having coffee when police moved in at 7.45 a.m. (0545 GMT), wrong-footing the protesters who had expected a police raid at 6 a.m. the earliest time police can enter a building under French law.</p>
<p>&quot;It is scandalous to break down a church gate and use violence against distressed people,&quot; said self-appointed mediator Stephane Hessel, a former French United Nations envoy.</p>
<p>Opposition Socialist Party spokesman Francois Hollande voiced shock. &quot;We were close to a negotiated settlement that would have ended a fast endangering lives,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The fasters, who like the other protesters have been in the church since June, have been drinking sweet tea and taking vitamin pills, but two are said to be in a serious condition.</p>
<p>&quot;They are not being taken to concentration camp, but to hospitals where they will surely feel better than at the church,&quot; said Michel Pericard, floor leader of the ruling RPR Gaullist party at the National Assembly.</p>
<p>&quot;The law is not to be negotiated but enforced,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The police raid came after Juppe announced on television on Thursday that France's highest administrative court, the Council of State, had endorsed his view that the 300 Africans were not legally entitled, as a group, to residence permits.</p>
<p>But he said the government still intended to review their right to remain in France on a case-by-case basis and had no intention of using deportation to break up families or expel seriously ill individuals.</p>
<p>Many of the protesters say they once had residence rights and were plunged into illegality by hardline 1993 immigration laws pushed through by then interior minister Charles Pasqua at a time of mounting anti-immigrant sentiment.</p>
<p>Lawyers say loopholes in the laws, which also tightened conditions for citizenship, have created a legal nightmare.</p>
<p>&quot;If there are holes in the law, they must be filled up but the whole law cannot be called into question. Deputies who voted it knew what they were doing,&quot; Pericard said.</p>
