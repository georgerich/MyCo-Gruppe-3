<headline>U.S. says Iraqi Kurds agree ceasefire.</headline>

<p>Leaders of Iraq's two main Kurdish factions agreed on Friday to end six days of fighting and to attend U.S.-mediated peace talks next month, the State Department said.</p>
<p>Spokesman Glyn Davies said in a statement that the agreement followed direct U.S. contacts with Massoud Barzani, leader of the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), and Jalal Talabani, leader of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK).  </p>
<p>Davies said the two leaders &quot;have agreed to cease the fighting (and) return their forces to the positions held before the current fighting began&quot; on August 17. He did not give a specific time for the ceasefire but said the United States looked forward to &quot;immediate implementation&quot;.</p>
<p>The two party leaders had also agreed to meet U.S. Assistant Secretary for Near Eastern Affairs Robert Pelletreau in September &quot;to solidify the cease-fire and to pursue reconciliation&quot;, Davies said.</p>
<p>His statement gave no venue or precise date for the meeting. The United States has already called on the Kurdish factions to hold peace talks in London.</p>
<p>The KDP said Thursday night it had repelled an attack by thousands of PUK fighters, killing, wounding or capturing about 400 opposing guerrillas. The fighting has threatened a U.S.-led peace plan to unite the mountainous Kurdish region in northern Iraq against President Saddam Hussein.</p>
