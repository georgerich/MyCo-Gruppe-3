<title>DENMARK: Danish Lego approves California theme park.</title>
<headline>Danish Lego approves California theme park.</headline>
<dateline>COPENHAGEN 1996-08-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>Danish toy manufacturer Lego announced on Thursday that its directors had given the final go-ahead to build a new theme park near San Diego, California, with a target opening date of spring 1999.</p>
<p>&quot;The project is already well into the planning stage but a final decision on putting it into action had been awaiting the results of the Windsor Legoland's first season,&quot; a company statement said in a reference to a similar park which opened at the English town of Windsor, just west of London, last March.</p>
<p>The Windsor development had fully lived up to expectations. &quot;It has been exceptionally well received by the season's estimated 1.4 million visitors, the local community and the media,&quot; the statement from the family-owned firm said.</p>
<p>Lego said that the California project, at Carlsbad, was likely to be its busiest so far, with expectations of 1.8 million visitors annually, compared with a record 1.3 million to its flagship park at Billund in western Denmark in 1995.</p>
<p>The company has said it would like to build Legolands throughout the world but so far had no definite overseas plans for parks beyond those at Windsor and Carlsbad.</p>
<p>Lego, the only European group among the world's top 10 toymakers, reported 1995 net profits down by close to 50 percent at 240 million crowns ($40 million).</p>
<p>It sees expansion of its parks, and entry into the computer games market as key ways to boost earnings.</p>
