<p>The human rights group Amnesty International said on Thursday that more than 6,000 people were reported killed in Burundi in the past three weeks, following the July 25 army coup.  </p>
<p>In a statement, the London-based human rights group said the human rights situation in Burundi continued to deteriorate despite promises by new Tutsi military ruler Pierre Buyoya to end killings.</p>
<p>Amnesty International said more than 6,000 people were reported to have been killed in various parts of Burundi in just three weeks after the July 25 coup.</p>
<p>It said it had learned at least 4,050 unarmed civilians were buried after being extrajudicially executed between July 27 and August 10 by government forces in Giheta district in the central province of Gitega.</p>
<p>&quot;Most of these victims were killed after the army came to their villages, ostensibly to obtain information about movements of rebels. Soldiers then assembled the victims and shot them,&quot; it said.</p>
