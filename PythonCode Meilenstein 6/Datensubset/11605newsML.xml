<p>European rate futures are back in fashion after a German-led round of credit easings and analysts on Friday said best bets are in calendar trades and Eurolire.</p>
<p>Peripheral European countries such as Italy had the most to gain from the Bundesbank's hefty 30 basis point repo cut on Thursday, they said. At the same time, front month contracts might not fare as well as some later-dated futures.</p>
<p>&quot;All the short ends are looking very, very positive. Short sterling is breaking up to new highs, Euromarks are breaking upwards,&quot; said Steve Hutt of NatWest Financial Futures.</p>
<p>&quot;The one concern is they are perhaps getting a little overbought,&quot; said Hutt, a technical analyst. He said in this environment a good buy would be &quot;deferred month&quot; contracts.</p>
<p>This meant selling the near-term futures contracts such as December Euromarks and December Eurolire and buying months such as June 1997 and Septmeber 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;Any more optimism for potentially more easing will be early next year,&quot; Hutt said. &quot;While that hope exists it's going to be the more deferred contracts that will catch up.&quot;</p>
<p>Among the main European contracts, Eurolire stood the best chance of outperforming, analysts said.</p>
<p>December Eurolire broke out of a downtrend on Thursday, insprired by the Bundesbank's interest rate cut. They climbed to a high of 92.00 -- implying three-month lira rates of eight percent come December -- from a 91.78 low.</p>
<p>By 1300 GMT, they had eased back to 91.91.</p>
<p>&quot;We've seen a bit of a pullback in Eurolire. It looks like mild proifit taking,&quot; said Peter Osler, head of research at GNI in London. &quot;Looking at that there's still upside scope.&quot;</p>
<p>Norman Beauchamp, head of derivatives at Cooperative Bank in London, was also a fan of the Italian market.</p>
<p>&quot;Eurolire I think is going to be the best performer,&quot; he said. &quot;With Germany cutting rates, that should allow Italy to cut rates.&quot;</p>
<p>He added, &quot;Although the December contract is probably discounting a 3/4 point rate cut. There's potentially 1-1/2 points and maybe two points.&quot;</p>
<p>Osler said the Bundesbank's action took pressure off other European currencie and that sooner or later the Bank of France too might cut interest rates unilaterly.</p>
<p>&quot;I would have thought we still have a little bit more upside on Pibor as well,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The September Pibor contract on the MATIF was last at 96.03, after surging to a 96.15 top on Thursday from a 95.75 low.</p>
<p>The one area analysts were a little nervous about, though, was short sterling, which is not tied to German rate policy in the way the other European contracts are.</p>
<p>&quot;I'd be a small seller of short sterling,&quot; Osler said.</p>
<p>The December short sterling contract has jumped to new contract highs following the cut. It was last at 94.28, having risen to a 94.32 peak earlier on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;On an outright basis in sterling from here I'd be a little hesitant to start buying the front contracts,&quot; said Hutt.</p>
<p>He said that three-month British money rates -- which short sterling is based on -- themselves are likely to have a premium over base rates after the next British policy easing.</p>
<p>&quot;As soon as they make one more move that will be factored in as definitely the last move,&quot; Hutt said. So although base rates may fall by 25 basis points, three-month money rates will probably fall by a smaller amount.</p>
<p>&quot;In the same way they cut the repo by 30 basis points but Euromarks ended up around 15,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But Hutt still favoured the deferred month contracts for short sterling as a calendar spread trade.</p>
