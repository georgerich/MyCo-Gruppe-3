<p>Oil-rich Norway's state budget will run up a surplus of about 35 billion crowns this year thanks mainly to high oil prices, daily Aftenposten said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The projected figure, based on the assumption that oil prices will remain at current levels, is 10 billion crowns higher than an official forecast by the finance ministry in May.</p>
<p>Aftenposten, which gave no source, said overall Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth this year was forecast to be 5.5 percent rather than 4.5 percent which was the official projection made in May.</p>
<p>&quot;It is indeed the oil income that has the biggest effect but mainland Norway is also doing better than expected,&quot; the newspaper said.</p>
<p>Mainland GDP, which in May was set to grow by three percent, now looks set to increase by about 3.5 percent, the report said.</p>
<p>The government has said it will plough the budget surplus into the State Petroleum Fund, which will ease long-run economic adjustments in the face of declining oil income and an ageing population at the beginning of the next century.</p>
<p>Norway produces about three million barrels of oil per day, most of which are exported, making the Scandinavian country the world's second largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia.</p>
