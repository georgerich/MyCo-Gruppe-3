<p>German steel and engineering group Fried. Krupp AG Hoesch-Krupp said Wednesday its profits tumbled 17 percent in the first half of 1996 as the weak German economy hurt the group's steel business.</p>
<p>Pre-tax earnings fell to 185 million marks ($124.2 million) in the first six months of the year, from 223 million marks ($149.7 million) in the year-ago period, even though all six of its business divisions were profitable.</p>
<p>Sales edged up 1 percent to 11.7 billion marks and orders rose 2 percent to 12.7 billion marks ($8.5 billion).</p>
<p>&quot;The decline is a result of the unsatisfactory economic development during the period under review,&quot; Krupp said. &quot;The drop in earnings in the steel sector and related industries could be only partially offset.&quot;</p>
<p>Krupp warned that business in the second half of the year would not recover as strongly as previously thought. The company's shares fell 2.7 percent to 214 marks ($143.67) on the Frankfurt stock exchange at midday.</p>
<p>The market took Krupp's statement as a profit warning, which also put pressure on shares in Thyssen AG, Germany's biggest steel maker.</p>
<p>Demand for steel in Europe in the first half of the year was well below year-earlier levels and put pressure on steel prices. Sales and turnover in the stainless steel division rose because of acquisitions, particularly the takeover of a majority stake in Italy's Acciai Speciali Terni.</p>
<p>Revenue rose 43 percent to 2.8 billion marks ($1.87 billion) and orders grew 35 percent to 2.5 billion marks ($1.68 billion), but Krupp said prices of flat steel products were not satisfactory.</p>
<p>Krupp said sales in the quality steel and sectional steel division fell 14 percent to 2.4 billion marks ($1.6 billion) and orders dropped 21 percent to 2.5 billion marks ($1.68 billion).</p>
<p>Engineering sales rose 8 percent to 1.4 billion marks ($939.9 million), but orders fell 8 percent because of divestments in the sector. Orders in the synthetics group, a subdivision of the engineering division, surpassed year-earlier levels.</p>
<p>Caterpillar Inc. will buy its Krupp MaK Maschinenbau engineering subsidiary, a leading maker of large diesel engines. It said the deal would close in the next few months.</p>
<p>Plant construction turnover surged 35 percent to 789 million marks ($529.7 million), while orders in the division jumped 81 percent because of the acquisition of Dortmund-based Uhde GmbH. Krupp said the takeover would improve its position in Asian and Latin American markets.</p>
<p>Sales in the processing division fell 10 percent to 1.3 billion marks ($872.8 million) and orders fell 18 percent to 1.4 billion marks ($939.9 million). Krupp said orders were unsatisfactory due to weakness in the car industry.</p>
<p>The weak steel business also hurt the trading and services division, where revenue slid 11 percent to 2.9 billion marks ($1.9 billion). Orders fell 10 percent to 3.1 billion marks ($2.1 billion).</p>
