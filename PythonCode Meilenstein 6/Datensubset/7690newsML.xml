<p>Rupert Murdoch's News Corp Ltd on Thursday announced a lower-than-expected profit for 1995-96 but forecast a 20 percent jump in earnings in 1996-97, partly because of the hit movie Independence Day.</p>
<p>&quot;A budgeted profit increase of at least 20 percent for the full year currently appears very attainable,&quot; the company said in announcing its 1995-96 full-year results.  </p>
<p>&quot;From an earnings perspective, the current fiscal year has begun with great promise due to the hit motion picture Independence Day, a moderating trend in paper prices and a solid forward book of advertising at the Fox Broadcasting Company, which will broadcast both the World Series and Super Bowl,&quot; it said in a statement.</p>
<p>In reporting its results for the year ended June 30, 1996, the company said that after tax and before abnormals, profit dropped six percent to A$1.26 billion (US$995 million).</p>
<p>Analysts had on average expected A$1.34 billion.</p>
