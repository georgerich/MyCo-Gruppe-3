<title>UK: LCE white sugar make little change in late trade.</title>
<headline>LCE white sugar make little change in late trade.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-08-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>White sugar futures remained near opening levels in quiet later trading on Friday ahead of the three-day weekend in London and Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The most-active October contract closed up $0.70 at $352.40 while December ended flat at $345.90.</p>
<p>The day's low volume was largely confined to the two front months with October recording 341 lots and December 153 lots.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think anyone really wants to stick their neck out on the whites,&quot; said one, adding that a sudden move in New York while London was closed would immediately affect the whites market when it re-opens on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The LCE is closed on Monday due to a public holiday and re-opens on Tuesday, August 27.</p>
<p>Activity on the Paris market was unimpressive and price movements were slight. October was up 10 cents at $352.40 and December down 50 cents at $347.00.</p>
<p>Matif volume amounted to 344 lots.</p>
