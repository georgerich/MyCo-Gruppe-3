<p>British Sky Broadcasting , the satellite television broadcaster 40 percent controlled by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp Ltd, plans to offer fast access to the Internet via conventional television sets when it introduces its digital satellite television service in 1997, the Financial Times reported.</p>
<p>BSkyB hopes that by broadcasting large amounts of information to the home, in addition to the 200 to 300 channels offered by digital television, will convince consumers to buy the decoder box needed to receive the service, the paper said.</p>
<p>&quot;The decoders will have the computing power of an average PC and a very fast modem,&quot; a BSkyB executive told the Financial Times.</p>
<p>BSkyB plans to offer two separate Internet services to consumers, as well as home banking, home shopping and other interactive services, the newspaper said.</p>
