<p>Lithuania's central bank said it was pleased on Thursday when parliament passed key laws aimed at helping the ailing banking sector.</p>
<p>Parliament passed laws to issue securities to recapitalise the troubled State Commercial Bank and to restructure it.</p>
<p>It also approved forming &quot;Property Bank&quot; to manage banks' bad loans and get the loans off their balance sheets.</p>
<p>&quot;The bad loan company should have been established long ago, it is a very important law,&quot; central bank chief Reinoldijus Sharkinas told Reuters.</p>
<p>Property Bank will take on and manage the bad loans. State-owned banks can sell bad loans to the new bank without restriction while the government decides which commercial banks can sell their bad loans.</p>
<p>Bad loans were seen as one of the main weaknesses in the banking system.</p>
<p>&quot;It is hard to estimate how big those loans will be and from which banks they will be taken,&quot; Sharkinas said. &quot;No one can say this today, but there is no other way.&quot;</p>
<p>The laws are seen vital to restructuring and recapitalising a sick banking sector in Lithuania, which has been independent from the former Soviet Union since 1991.</p>
<p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) also welcomed the passing of the new banking legislation.</p>
<p>&quot;These laws are more than welcome,&quot; IMF Lithuania resident representative Domenico Fannizza told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;The government will be able to start restructuring and recapitalising these banks and the State Commercial Bank in particular,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Lithuania's banks fell into crisis earlier this year when two of its top banks, Innovation Bank and Litimpeks, were closed for being insolvent. Litimpeks was later reopened.</p>
<p>But State Commercial Bank, the third largest bank in the country, later began to suffer from liquidity problems.</p>
<p>State Commercial Bank's losses totalled 104 million litas in the first half of the year, and its assets fell to 353 million litas from 733 million litas in the same period.</p>
<p>The bank's bad loans were estimated at 33 percent, or 300 million litas, of the total loan portfolio.</p>
<p>Law on the State Commercial Bank calls for the issue of 90 million litas of securities to recapitalise it and for its total control by the state.</p>
<p>But the government wants to privatise the bank as soon as possible.</p>
