<p>U.S. oil companies with interests in Ecuador privately expressed concern Wednesday about the implications of developments in Ecuador in the past two days.</p>
<p>Tuesday evening's move by Ecuador's energy and mines minister Alfredo Adoum to halt production by Maxus Energy Corp, a unit of Argentina's YPF SA, over a contract dispute was followed Wednesday by government-owned Petroecuador's announcement that it would revise all existing contracts with foreign oil companies.  </p>
<p>&quot;It makes us feel very uncomfortable,&quot; said an executive at a U.S. oil company with interests in Ecuador. &quot;It's very confused and there are just too many things going on there a week and a half after they've had a change of government.&quot;</p>
<p>The economically conservative administration of President Sixto Duran lost out to the populist, centre-left President Abdula Bucaram's Roldosista Party, which made free-spending promises during the campaign.</p>
<p>Following the Petroecuador move on Wednesday, the state company's union called for a ban on more foreign oil companies which it said operated inefficiently.  </p>
<p>&quot;We think we've got a good agreement with the government there, but clearly it's a volatile situation,&quot; said another U.S. oil company official who didn't want to be named.</p>
<p>Maxus is the largest foreign equity oil producer in Ecuador, with average 1995 production of just under 30,000 barrels a day of heavy oil from its Block 16, compared with Petroecuador's 305,000 bpd.</p>
<p>Maxus is the only one of the foreign companies which has an agreement which doesn't include production sharing with  </p>
<p>Petroecuador. Maxus executive vice president Mark Miller said on Wednesday that his company's representatives were negotiating with Petroecuador and hoped for an amicable resolution.</p>
<p>Occidental Petroleum Corp is the second largest, operating Block 15 in the Oriente Basin near the border with Colombia. Its share of production was about 23,000 bpd last year.</p>
<p>Texas-based Oryx Energy is the third largest foreign company operator, with 12,400 bpd from its Block 7 in Oriente basin through a joint venture with Germany's Preussag Energie, CLAPSA, SIPETROL (both of Chile), and Petroequador.  </p>
<p>Other foreign oil companies with smaller interests include Elf Aquitaine, Tripetrol and City Investing.</p>
<p>Joint venture partners ARCO (60 percent) and Agip (40 percent) own the Villano field in the Oriente province, containing about 160 million barrels in recoverable reserves.</p>
<p>In June, the the joint venture agreed terms with Petroecuador to build a 105-mile (171 km) pipeline to connect Villano with the trans-Ecuadorian pipeline, flowing about 30,000 barrels a day to the trunk line initially, rising to 80,000 bpd. Completion is expected in 1999.</p>
