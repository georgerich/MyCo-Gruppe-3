<p>Russian officials, keen to cut capital flight, will adopt tight measures to cut barter deals in foreign trade to a minimum, a customs official said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;We have always been concerned about barter deals with other countries, viewing them as a disguised kind of capital flight from Russia,&quot; Marina Volkova, deputy head of the currency department at the State Customs Committee, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Volkova said last year goods had been exported under many Russian barter deals, with nothing imported in return. She said the cost of such unimported goods was $1.10 billion in 1995.</p>
<p>Barter deals were worth $4.9 billion last year, or about eight percent of all Russian exports estimated at $61.5 billion, she said.</p>
<p>&quot;The cost of exported goods is too often understated, so the actual share of barter deals in Russian exports and the amount of unimported goods may be even higher,&quot; Volkova said.</p>
<p>A few days ago Russian President Boris Yeltsin issued a decree on state regulation of foreign barter deals, and Volkova said this &quot;could substantially improve the situation&quot;.</p>
<p>In line with the decree, which will come into force on November 1, all Russian barter traders will be obliged to import goods worth the cost of their exports within 180 days.</p>
<p>&quot;If traders are late, they will have to pay fines worth the cost of their exported goods,&quot; Volkova said.</p>
<p>Understating the cost of exported goods could still be a loophole for barter dealers, but Volkova said the authorities are currently &quot;tackling the technicalities of the issue&quot;.</p>
<p>Barter has always been a feature of the Soviet Union's foreign trade, but Yeltsin's decrees liberalising foreign trade in 1991-1992 has given barter a new impetus.</p>
<p>A few years ago, barter deals accounted for up to 25-30 percent of Russian exports because &quot;thousands (of) trade companies which popped up preferred barter in the absence of reliable Russian banks and money transfer systems&quot;, Volkova said.</p>
<p>&quot;Now many Russian banks are strong and can make various sorts of money tranfers, while incompetent traders are being ousted by more experienced ones. But the current share of barter deals in Russian exports is still high,&quot; she said.</p>
