<p>A boy was decapitated and 12 were injured when a commuter train rammed into a school minibus in the Philippine capital on Thursday, police said.</p>
<p>The minibus driver, carrying students to one of Manila's leading schools, told investigators he was not aware the train was coming because his view was blocked by a bus speeding across the tracks.</p>
<p>The bus made it across safely.</p>
<p>Police said a 14-year-old student was thrown out of the minibus and decapitated as the train crushed him. The train sped on without stopping, Sergeant Mario Ocampo said.</p>
<p>The minibus driver has been charged with homicide and causing multiple physical injuries through reckless imprudence, Ocampo said.</p>
