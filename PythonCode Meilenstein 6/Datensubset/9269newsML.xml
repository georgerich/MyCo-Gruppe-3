<p>The alleged weight problems of reigning Miss Universe Alicia Machado are probably a case of wisdom teeth, not a sweet tooth, her mother said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;When she left Venezuela (two weeks ago) her face was swollen due to her wisdom teeth which were taken out,&quot; Marta Fajardo told Reuters in a telephone interview from Maracay, central Venezuela.</p>
<p>Machado, 19, found herself at the centre of a dispute this week when pageant organisers in Venezuela said her crown was in danger unless she went on a crash diet. But Miss Universe organisers quickly denied they had ordered Machado to lose 27 pounds (12 kg) in two weeks or lose the title.</p>
<p>Fajardo insisted her daughter, who weighed 112 pounds (51 kg) when she won the Miss Universe title in Las Vegas in May, had perfectly normal eating habits. &quot;Everybody has their own addiction to something or other but it's not as if she eats cakes like crazy,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>The weight scandal has been front page news in Venezuela, which is proud of its reputation as the world's beauty queen capital. Machado, who faced the full glare of publicity on Wednesday night at a Miss Teen USA pageant in New Mexico, is the fourth Venezuelan to take the Miss Universe crown.</p>
