<p>China's central bank said on Wednesday it had made no statement about an interest rate cut set for Friday.</p>
<p>An official at the People's Bank of China said in response to a question: &quot;We have not said that there will be a change in interest rates on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;As for any speculation from the outside, the People's Bank has no comment.&quot;</p>
<p>Banking sources have noted market talk of a cut in lending and deposit rates set for Friday.</p>
<p>China trimmed interest rates on May 1, and analysts have speculated a further reduction was likely to be made soon because of easing inflation.  </p>
<p>In May, the central bank trimmed interest rates on loans by 0.75 percentage point and on deposits by 0.98 point on average.</p>
<p>Inflation has been well within the state's target of 10 percent for this year.</p>
<p>Central bank governor Dai Xianglong has said that a second cut in interest rates was possible this year although he stressed this did not mean an easing of tight monetary policies.</p>
<p>Asked to comment on the latest speculation, a central bank spokesman said: &quot;We have not been advised of any cut in rates. If there is a cut planned for Friday we should know about it.&quot;</p>
