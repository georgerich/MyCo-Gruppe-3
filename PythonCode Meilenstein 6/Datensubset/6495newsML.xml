<p>A Bonn parliamentary commission is to examine the failure of Germany's BND intelligence service to prevent the export of chemical weapons-making technology to Libya, the commission chairman said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Authorities this week revealed that 3.2 million marks' ($2.15 million) worth of state-of-the-art equipment to mix poison gases was sent to Libya from Germany between 1990 and 1993 in defiance of German arms control laws.</p>
<p>The influential Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper reported that authorities were also weighing probes of other companies that may have helped Libya develop its arms programme.</p>
<p>&quot;The BND has given relevant German authorities results of its foreign reconnaissance from Libya that suggest German companies supplied products for Libya's armament programme in other cases as well, for example to build missiles,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>It gave no source for the report, which was released ahead of publication on Thursday.</p>
<p>The BND has conceded that it interviewed one of the suspects in the poison-gas case four years ago without discovering the deals. It denied reports that the man, Lebanese-born businessman Berge Balanian, had worked as a BND informer.</p>
<p>Parliamentary control commission chairman Wilfried Penner of the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) told German Radio the commission would &quot;examine this matter intensively, probably next week&quot;.</p>
<p>He said there was no evidence the government had acted wrongly in the matter. But Manfred Such, the opposition Greens member of the control commission, said the BND's version of events was implausible.</p>
<p>&quot;The BND's account that it had for years been speaking to Balanian about Libya in general but failed to find out about the poison gas deal...is hard to imagine.</p>
<p>&quot;And if the BND really had no idea about a deal of this importance, this would again call into question the quality of its insight and the value of the BND,&quot; Such said in a statement.</p>
