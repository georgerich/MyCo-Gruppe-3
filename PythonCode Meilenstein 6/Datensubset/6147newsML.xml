<text>
<p>Mexican stocks have been trading electronically all morning but the transaction data have not been released to the public, a stock exchange spokesman said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>But floor trading has been delayed because of a protest by students and their parents that blocked the entrance of the stock exhcange building, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>&quot;If by 0930 (1430 GMT) nothing has been arranged with these people, we are going to free up the system (and release trading results),&quot; the spokesman told Reuters, asking that his name be withheld.  </p>
<p>Earlier Wednesday, traders from two major brokerage houses said stocks were not trading electronically, but the bolsa spokesman disputed those claims.</p>
<p>As of 0935 local time/1030 EDT/1435 GMT, trading data had not been transmitted to computer terminals tied to the automated trading system, known by its Spanish acronym SATO.</p>
