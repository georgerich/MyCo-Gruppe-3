<p>Midwest direct cash hog prices early Thursday were seen $0.50 to $1.00 per cwt lower, pressured by larger-than-expected interior hog receipts and a slump in pork product demand, livestock dealers said.</p>
<p>Interior Iowa/southern Minnesota hog receipts Tuesday totaled 110,000 head, well above that day's estimate of 100,000. Wednesday's estimate was 100,000 head.</p>
<p>Tops in Iowa and Minnesota on hogs delivered to plants were expected at $58.50 per cwt and Illinois hogs could have a top of $58.00. Indiana buyers expect prices to fall $0.50 to $1.00, with a top of $57.00 to $57.50.  </p>
<p>Larger marketings were resulting in expanded pork production at about the same time that demand moved into a slump, market sources said.</p>
<p>Wholesale pork prices at midday were quoted by USDA $2.00 to $4.00 lower for fresh pork bellies and $2.00 lower for loins. Values by the end of the day could be even lower, market sources said.</p>
<p>USDA estimated hog slaughter Wednesday at 348,000 head, which brought the week to date figure to 1.008 million, up 1.0 percent from a week ago and down 1.9 percent from a year ago.</p>
