<p>It's not easy to instil revolutionary values when your target generation regards the landlord bogeyman of communist idealism as a reasonable businessman looking for his rightful profit.</p>
<p>But with the 20th anniversary of the death of China's late Chairman Mao Zedong approaching and the reviving of spiritual values topping the agenda of the ruling Communist Party, propaganda officials are trying to do just that.</p>
<p>The latest tool is the model opera, &quot;The White-Haired Girl&quot; -- one of only eight operas that were permitted by Mao's wife, Jiang Qing, to be performed during the 10 chaotic years of the ultra-leftist Cultural Revolution.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Ballet Theatre this month revived the 1940s propaganda tale of the trials of a peasant girl whose hair turns white after she escapes from the clutches of an evil landlord who bought her when after her father, a tenant farmer, fails to pay his rent.</p>
<p>The Beijing revival has been a sellout. Responses more mixed.</p>
<p>Thirty years ago -- even 20 years ago -- Chinese audiences broke down in tears over scenes such as the mistreatment of the White-Haired Girl by the landlord's ageing mother.</p>
<p>The tale provoked such emotion that when the story was first staged in the 1940s at the late Chairman's Mao Zedong's resistance base in remote western Yanan, one soldier leapt from his seat, took out his gun and tried to shoot the landlord.</p>
<p>Today, the appearance of the landlord raises titters.</p>
<p>One of the main sponsors of the revival, the China Work Committee for Nurturing the Next Generation, said its aim was to educate young people in traditional revolutionary values.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to give teenagers a traditional education and enrich their cultural life,&quot; a committee official said. &quot;The White-Haired Girl is a story with a historical background and political content. We want children to know what life was like in the past.&quot;</p>
<p>The official acknowledged that the mix of traditional values in a society racing to modernise may be confusing.</p>
<p>&quot;Many children ask why debtors today are not so respectful to their creditors. This is not right,&quot; he said. &quot;We cannot use a historical story to explain a current social phenomenon.&quot;</p>
<p>It is a muddle echoed in the audience.</p>
<p>Wang Lizhu, 41, was given free tickets by a friend and wanted his 12-year-old daughter to see a ballet, but not necessarily a work of revolutionary propaganda.</p>
<p>&quot;As for children these days, they don't know anything about exploition by the landlords or the oppression before Liberation,&quot; he said, referring to the official name for the 1949 communist victory.</p>
<p>&quot;Some think that the White-Haired Girl's father must pay because he owed money to the landlord,&quot; he said. &quot;So you can see this play can't have any political function, it's rather out of date.&quot;</p>
<p>Ballet critic Ou Jianping agreed.</p>
<p>&quot;The characters that are supposed to be ugly and vicious are no longer hateful but laughable,&quot; Ou said. &quot;The audience laughs at them nowadays.&quot;</p>
<p>That wasn't quite what the sponsors, or the propaganda tsars who actually approved the performance, had in mind.</p>
<p>Spiritual civilisation -- communist jargon for values -- has been selected as the watchword of party policy this year. The theme will dominate the annual party plenum next month and has held sway throughout the party-controlled media for months.</p>
<p>Newspaper front pages have fielded paeans to a model army officer who searches for water in the deserts of Inner Mongolia, a bureaucrat killed in a car crash after years of harsh living in remote and backward Tibet, and a party secretary who set up factories and donated a fortune to his poverty-ridden village.</p>
<p>&quot;We are using these examples of real heroes to teach people of today to have better values,&quot; said one senior government official.</p>
<p>An array of opportunities to make money, often at the expense of others, has opened up with paramount leader Deng Xiaoping's market reforms.</p>
<p>One consequence has been the rapid -- and to communist leaders alarming -- erosion of the spirit of altruism espoused by Mao.</p>
<p>Such dramas as the White-Haired Girl ballet offer a propaganda pill more palatable to the average Chinese.</p>
<p>&quot;It was very beautiful,&quot; said one middle-aged woman, who said she saw the opera many times as a child during the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution. &quot;I felt very nostalgic for those times.&quot;</p>
<p>Her daughter, not born until after the tumultuous movement when ideology was paramount, admitted she barely understood the storyline but enjoyed the dance.</p>
<p>Ballet critic Ou was slightly disappointed.</p>
<p>&quot;The ballet has lost its revolutionary spirit,&quot; he said. &quot;You don't feel that you are watching workers, peasants and soldiers fighting for the revolution, but just pretty dancers.</p>
<p>&quot;The strong fists of the past have been replaced by soft, graceful hands,&quot; he said. &quot;It's just a ballet. It has lost the realistic power, the dynamism it had in the past.&quot;</p>
