<p>An Israeli cabinet minister proposed on Friday taking steps to cut growing dependence on foreign workers who have taken jobs which are off-limits to Palestinians and unwanted by Jews.</p>
<p>&quot;We will propose expelling about 1,000 illegal foreign labourers from Israel a month,&quot; Labour and Welfare Minister Eli Ishai said before the cabinet debated the issue at its weekly meeting on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;The number of legal workers also should be cut,&quot; he told Israel radio.</p>
<p>The cabinet put off until next week a decision on expulsion.</p>
<p>Ishai's proposal was no blueprint for a mass exodus from Israel of workers from countries such as Romania, Thailand, Turkey and China who now do the low-paying manual jobs of Palestinians barred from the Jewish state for security reasons.</p>
<p>It would take authorities more than eight years to expel all of the 100,000 foreigners he said were working in Israel without a permit -- assuming police could round all of them up and no new illegal labourers slipped into the country.</p>
<p>Ishai said: &quot;There is a problem here. (Hiring foreign workers) pays -- it is good for building contractors....We may have to keep a quota of foreign workers. The question is how many.&quot; He said 200,000 foreigners work in Israel -- half of them illegally.</p>
<p>Many Israelis initially welcomed the blue-collar foreign influx at the height of the six-year-long Palestinian uprising that began in 1987, during the course of which Arab guerrillas knifed Jews in Israeli cities.</p>
<p>But while the Palestinians had been required by Israeli law to return to their homes in the occupied territories each evening, the foreigners who replaced them remain overnight in squalid housing that has become an eyesore.</p>
<p>&quot;Go look at the old central bus station area (in Tel Aviv). It has all the things you see in the Bronx,&quot; legislator Ran Cohen told the radio, comparing the foreign workers' slum area to the New York borough known for poverty and crime.</p>
<p>Cohen called for the establishment of &quot;transit camps&quot; to hold illegal immigrants for several days before expulsion, a proposal which his left-wing Meretz party colleague Amnon Rubinstein said would hurt Israel's image.</p>
<p>&quot;It won't be a concentration camp,&quot; Cohen snapped.</p>
<p>The Palestinian Authority has demanded Israel allow more of its people in to work, saying an Israeli closure had crippled the economy in the self-ruled areas.</p>
<p>Before the Palestinian uprising, as many as 160,000 Arabs from the West Bank and Gaza worked in Israel.</p>
<p>Israel sealed off the territories and stopped Palestinians from entering in February after the first in a series of Moslem suicide bombings that killed 59 people -- including seven Romanian workers. Today some 30,000 Palestinians work in Israel.</p>
<p>Ishai, an ultraorthodox Jew, took a high-profile tour on Thursday of a ramshackle Tel Aviv neighbourhood now home to thousands of foreign workers.</p>
<p>Municipal authorities, especially in Tel Aviv, complain they cannot cope with the social, health and crime problems posed by the labourers.</p>
<p>But Nigerians cleaning Israelis' apartments, Thais picking flowers in greenhouses, Chinese construction workers and Filipina nannies heading to church on Sundays have become permanent fixtures in the Jewish state.</p>
