<p>A strong performance from its UK hotels and a recovery in retail betting revenues should help leisure group Ladbroke to increase interim pre-tax profits to around 65-70 million stg next Thursday, analysts said.</p>
<p>Ladbroke had pre-tax, pre-exceptional profit of 56.5 million stg in the first six months of 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;The results should not be disappointing. They will benefit from a strong UK hotel environment, both in London and the provinces,&quot; said one analyst.</p>
<p>&quot;The one weaker point could be the continental European hotels,&quot; he added.  </p>
<p>Ladbroke chairman John Jackson told shareholders in May that profit before tax in the first four months of 1996 was ahead of the corresponding period in 1995.</p>
<p>Hotel performance in the UK was particularly strong with revenue per available room up 16 percent in London, he said.</p>
<p>Ladbroke's Hilton International hotels were reported to be performing well but trading in continental Europe &quot;remained under pressure&quot;.</p>
<p>Jackson said talks were taking place with Hilton Hotels Corp of the U.S., on reuniting the Hilton brand but added that these were at an early stage.  </p>
<p>Hilton Hotels has the rights to the name in the U.S., while Ladbroke uses it in other parts of the world.</p>
<p>The betting and gaming division has been badly hit over the past 18 months by the success of the National Lottery, operated by the Camelot consortium.</p>
<p>Ladbroke has said that the outlook for 1996 is better thanks to cost-cutting and a one percentage point reduction in betting duty to 6.75 percent announced in last November's budget. The reduction took effect on March 1.  </p>
<p>Ladbroke's Vernons football pools division has also suffered from the effects of the Lottery. Pools betting duty was cut by five percentage points to 27.5 percent last December in a bid to boost the industry.</p>
<p>Operating profit from hotels was 150.2 million stg in 1995 while betting and gaming contributed 58.1 million.</p>
<p>Pre-tax profit on ordinary activites in 1995 totalled 121.3 million stg, down from 128.5 million in 1994.</p>
