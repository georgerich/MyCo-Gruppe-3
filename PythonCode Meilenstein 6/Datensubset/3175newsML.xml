<p>Former president F.W. de Klerk addresses South Africa's &quot;truth commission&quot; on Wednesday in a bid to explain why his National Party plunged the country into 46 years of apartheid misery.</p>
<p>De Klerk, who acknowledged in 1990 that South Africa's race policies were untenable and began reforms that led to majority rule four years later, will present his party's overview of apartheid to Archbishop Desmond Tutu's Truth and Reconciliation Commssion.</p>
<p>He said this week the presentation would take the long view, starting with the 1652 arrival of the Dutch ancestors of today's Afrikaners in Cape Town, site of the truth commission hearing.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm looking forward to the opportunity to...put what happened from our vantage point in the proper context,&quot; de Klerk said. &quot;Part of that will also be to accept overall responsibility for many things which went wrong.&quot;</p>
<p>Since it began work in April, Tutu's commission has heard a lengthy litany of what went wrong, ranging from torture to police hit-squad killings and burning tyre &quot;necklace&quot; murders.</p>
<p>Harrowing testimony has been given by black survivors of the white minority government's campaign against the African National Congress -- which under President Nelson Mandela now rules the country -- and other liberation movements.</p>
<p>But on Monday the commission heard bitter criticism of the National Party, which implemented apartheid in 1948, from de Klerk's fellow-Afrikaner, General Constand Viljoen.</p>
<p>Viljoen, a former defence force chief who heads a right-wing party pressing for Afrikaner self-determination, began the series of party submissions to the commission by saying apartheid's foot soldiers should not get all the blame.</p>
<p>&quot;It is unfair that the operators be exposed as the chief perpetrators of atrocities when the politicians and strategy managers hide behind their status and positions,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The masterminds behind this crucible of past iniquities more than anybody else should account for their schemes even if that brings political embarrassment to their parties today.&quot;</p>
<p>De Klerk, who jointly won the Nobel peace prize with Mandela in 1993, is now trying to position his party as a credible opposition to the ANC, repeatedly disowning its past as the whites-only architect of apartheid.</p>
<p>Most of the leaders of the party today are relative moderates while such apartheid stalwarts as Hendrik Verwoerd, John Vorster and P.W. Botha are dead or deep in retirement.</p>
<p>Mandela's government set up the truth commission in the belief that it could heal the wounds of apartheid by exposing as full a picture as possible of the crimes and atrocities committed by all sides.</p>
