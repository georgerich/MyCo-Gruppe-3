<p>Bank Negara Malaysia said it borrowed for a one-month deposit from the interbank market at 6.95 to 7.05 percent against 6.95 previously.</p>
<p>The borrowing was part of the central bank's open market operations. Bank Negara regularly intervenes in the local interbank market to keep a check on liquidity or set interest rates as part of its efforts to fight inflation.</p>
<p>But, it has not been in the market for nearly three months despite rising liquidity that has pressured rates downward, threatening to thwart the Bank's tight monetary policy.</p>
<p>It was last in the market on May 24.  </p>
<p>Money market dealers said the intervention indicated that Bank Negara has not eased its tight monetary policy.</p>
<p>While the volume that Bank Negara took was not known, it was expected to give a psychological boost to interest rates, particularly for short-term rates, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Rates are already firming up at the short-end. But, we don't know what the impact is going to be,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>He said rates of up to one-month had gone up by five to 10 basis points immediately after Bank Negara's announcement.</p>
