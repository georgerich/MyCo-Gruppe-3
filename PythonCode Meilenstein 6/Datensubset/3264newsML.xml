<title>RUSSIA: Russian companies to issue bonds to settle tax.</title>

<p>Russian companies will be able to issue bonds to the finance ministry to settle some of their tax arrears, allowing the government to raise at least part of the money it is owed, a finance ministry official said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>A new decree signed by President Boris Yeltsin allows companies to issue bonds to cover tax owed up to the beginning of this year, Valentina Pryanichnikova, head of the ministry's issues department, told Reuters.</p>
<p>The government decides what proportion of a company's tax arrears can be covered by bonds.</p>
<p>The ministry can hold the bonds to maturity, or sell them on the free market, she said.</p>
<p>The decree orders the finance ministry and Federal Commission on the Capital Markets to set terms for bond issues and sales.</p>
<p>&quot;There will be a tax shortfall, no doubt,&quot; Pryanichnikova said. &quot;But the situation is such when all measures are good.&quot;</p>
<p>The Russian economy is burdened by a widespread failure to pay bills, with government and companies not paying many wages, companies not paying bills to each other, and companies not paying taxes.</p>
<p>Russia has only collected 60 percent of budgeted taxes so far this year prompting the International Monetary Fund to delay payment of the July tranche of its $10 billion loan because of concerns about the impact on fiscal policy.</p>
<p>Pryanichnikova said budget revenues from the decree would depend on the maturity of the bonds and the financial situation of companies. The government still has to define which companies will be allowed to issue bonds, their maturity and which property can be taken as collateral against the bonds.</p>
