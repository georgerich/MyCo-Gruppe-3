<p>Norway said on Thursday it would hunt down and expose paedophiles and dealers in child pornography using the Internet for the sexual exploitation of children.</p>
<p>Norway's ombudsman for children, Trond Waage, has joined forces with Save the Children Norway to study the distribution of child pornography on the Internet and how paedophiles operate on the international computer network.</p>
<p>&quot;We are exploring how the Internet is used by criminals to sell child pornography and operate other forms of commercial and sexual exploitation of children,&quot; Waage told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;We know there are individuals, from the more professional out to make money down to dirty animals, who use the Net for these purposes, but we can't say yet if this is relatively small scale or widespread.&quot;</p>
<p>Waage was speaking on the day thousands of Belgians attended a memorial service in Liege for two eight-year-old girls starved to death by a paedophile gang in a case that has shaken the country.</p>
<p>The results of the initial Norwegian study will be presented next week at the world's first conference against sexual exploitation of children in Stockholm.</p>
<p>Save the Children Norway wants to spearhead an international network for monitoring the Internet for child porn in cooperation with other Save the Children groups and the Bangkok-based End Child Prostitution in Asian Tourism (ECPAT).</p>
<p>The project has hired computer experts and skilled &quot;surfers&quot; to try to break tangles of codes and synonyms and identify the Internet sites where paedophiles communicate and store pictures and information.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to give a signal to the people misusing the net: &quot;Don't feel too sure that we won't find you, whatever codes and synonyms you use. There is now a body in Norway that will use resources to hunt these criminals down,&quot; Waage said.</p>
<p>He said he had been warned by experts to drop plans to block use of the Internet for child pornography by &quot;bombing&quot; the paedophiles' communication sites with a computer virus.</p>
<p>&quot;We wanted to establish a network of bomb squads but we were advised not to use this as a solution because of the great risk of receiving return bombs,&quot; Waage said.</p>
<p>The spread of the multi-media Internet system means paedophiles can communicate with one another or buy child pornography from the safety of their home with little risk of detection.</p>
<p>&quot;In the good old days if you had child pornography you had to dig a hole in the garden to hide it or stash it in the loft. Nowadays it can just be hidden in your computer or on disk,&quot; said Lars Groenseth, spokesman for Save the Children Norway.</p>
<p>Waage said experts had identified three main operating methods, the most professional being via pornography &quot;shops&quot;. But there are also paedophile rings and chat groups.</p>
<p>&quot;We assume the paedophile rings organise activities for one another on a regional, national and international level. In a chat group you probably have to build up trust over some time. But once the trust is there they exchange information and introduce each other to a wider network,&quot; he said.</p>
