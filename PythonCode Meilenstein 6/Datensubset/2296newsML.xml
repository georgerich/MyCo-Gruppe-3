<headline>Chains may raise prices after minimum wage hike.</headline>

<p>The higher minimum wage signed into law Tuesday will be welcome relief for millions of workers, but it may also translate into higher prices for hamburgers, pizzas and other fast-food items, some restaurant chains said.</p>
<p>The 90-cent-an-hour increase will have little short-term impact on many fast-food chains that already pay workers rates above the federally mandated minimum.</p>
<p>But in the long run, industry officials fear that workers already earning above the new minimum wage, which will rise to $5.15 an hour next year, will be looking for more.</p>
<p>&quot;What we're concerned about is the ripple effect it brings,&quot; said Bruce Cotton, chief spokesman for Long John Silver's Restaurants Inc. in Lexington, Ky.</p>
<p>&quot;Our average crew wage is about $5.20 (an hour) so short-term there is not going to be any impact,&quot; said Denny Lynch, spokesman for Wendy's International Inc., which operates about 4,300 restaurants in the United States.</p>
<p>President Clinton signed into law the first increase in the minimum wage in five years, boosting it by 50 cents to $4.75 on Oct. 1 and 40 cents more to $5.15 on Sept. 1, 1997.</p>
<p>The White House estimates the new law will mean a raise for about 10 million American workers, many of them in restaurants and stores.</p>
<p>Most small businesses had opposed the increase, saying it would prompt them to hire fewer people, particularly young people looking for entry-level jobs.</p>
<p>But some economists argued that the negative effects of an increase in the wage, first imposed by the federal government in 1938 at 25 cents an hour, would be minimal.</p>
<p>To help get the bill through the Republican-controlled Congress, a package of about $22 billion in tax breaks aimed mostly at small businesses was added to the measure.</p>
<p>As a result of the higher minimum wage, American Restaurant Partners L.P., which operates 62 Pizza Hut restaurant franchises, expects its total wage costs will rise $500,000 over the next 12 months.</p>
<p>&quot;If you raise someone who started in the last two months (to the new minimum wage level), you also have to raise everybody else,&quot; said Terry Freund, chief financial officer of American Restaurant Partners.</p>
<p>To compensate, the Wichita, Kan.-based restaurant operator hopes to raise prices by about 3 percent. The risk, Freund added, is that higher prices will keep some customers away or prompt them to scale back on the pizzas or other items they normally order.</p>
<p>Beyond the minimum wage requirements, competition for workers -- from cooks to delivery drivers to counter staff -- has forced many fast-food chains to pay up to hire good help, particularly in metropolitan markets. That competition is being driven by an increase in restaurant openings, particularly fast-food and casual dining establishments.</p>
<p>&quot;There are neighbourhoods where we have to pay $6.00 an hour to $6.50 or $7.00 to get&quot; good workers, Wendy's Lynch said. &quot;The competition is setting the wage.&quot;</p>
<p>Fast-food industry executives said there has been competition for workers since the late 1980s, although the increase in restaurant openings is making the search for employees more intense.</p>
<p>Another problem for fast-food chains is wage competition from other employers. A fast-food worker, for example, may be able to earn $50 or $60 a night in tips at a casual dining establishment, executives said.</p>
<p>&quot;For QSRs (quick service restaurants) ... it's even tougher to keep the kids,&quot; said Roger Lipton, president of Lipton Financial Services.</p>
