<headline>EU's Van Miert says VW aid row still unresolved.</headline>

<p>European Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert said on Friday a row between the European Union and Germany over aid to German car maker Volkswagen AG had still to be resolved.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think you can say we were able to overcome the problems today,&quot; Van Miert told a news conference after meeting German Economic Affairs Minister Guenter Rexrodt.</p>
<p>The row over public aid to VW erupted last month when premier Kurt Biedenkopf of the eastern state of Saxony overrode Commission objections to the size of the aid package and paid out extra funds.</p>
<p>Biedenkopf, a Christian Democrat (CDU) ally of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, warned the state stood to lose thousands of jobs in the towns of Mosel and Chemnitz if it did not pay.</p>
<p>Rexrodt said after the meeting the European Commission and Germany will in the next few days try to reach a &quot;pragmatic&quot; solution to the row over the public aid to Volkswagen.</p>
<p>&quot;I think this is one success of our meeting today,&quot; Rexrodt told a news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;We have agreed that in the next few days we shall be trying to come to a pragmatic settlement for the VW case in the present situation,&quot; Rexrodt added.</p>
<p>He said such a solution may allow for the Commission to withdraw the case it is bringing to the European Court of Justice.</p>
<p>Rexrodt said the situation in former east Germany could not be compared to the situation in any other member state.</p>
<p>VW had suspended plans to develop plants in the two towns after the EU executive in June rejected 241 million marks ($161.7 million) of the total promised aid package of some 780 million.</p>
<p>Van Miert reacted furiously to Saxony's defiant move, saying the decision to pay 91 million marks in unauthorised support to VW could touch off an EU &quot;subsidy war&quot; if left unchallenged.</p>
<p>He threatened to block other aid to Europe's largest carmaker or excluding it from public tenders.</p>
<p>Bonn has said it accepts Saxony's arguments but it believes the state went too far by defying the order from Brussels.</p>
