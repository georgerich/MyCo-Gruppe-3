<p>The French people are losing faith in television's ability to keep them informed and teach them good citizenship, according to a public opinion poll released on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The CSA poll, conducted for the Roman Catholic weekly La Vie, found that 58 percent of adults believed television was doing a good job of keeping them in touch with world events, compared with 74 percent two years ago.</p>
<p>Just 21 percent thought television was performing well in teaching them to be good citizens, down from 30 percent two years ago.</p>
<p>&quot;The French broadcaster increasingly sees viewers as consumers rather than as citizens,&quot; the magazine concluded.</p>
<p>The poll was based on interviews conducted in late July with 1,003 adults aged 18 and over.</p>
