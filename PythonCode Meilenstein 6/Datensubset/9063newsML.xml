<p>The human rights group Amnesty International said on Thursday more than 6,000 people were reported killed in Burundi in the first three weeks after an army coup last month.</p>
<p>In a statement, the London-based human rights group said human rights in Burundi continued to deteriorate despite promises by Tutsi military ruler Pierre Buyoya to end killings.</p>
<p>Amnesty International said more than 6,000 people were reported to have been killed in various parts of Burundi in three weeks from the July 25 coup.</p>
<p>It said it had learned at least 4,050 unarmed civilians were buried after being extrajudicially executed between July 27 and August 10 by government forces in Giheta district in the central province of Gitega.</p>
<p>&quot;Most of these victims were killed after the army came to their villages, ostensibly to obtain information about movements of rebels,&quot; Amnesty International said.</p>
<p>&quot;Soldiers then assembled the victims and shot them, apparently after they denied knowledge of the wherabouts of rebels,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>&quot;The 4,050 victims do not include people who may have died from gunshot and other wounds in the bush or drowned in rivers while fleeing,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>&quot;As the army reportedly prevented access by independent observers to Nyabitanga, Mugera and Giheta areas, it becomes very difficult to obtain more details on such killings,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>&quot;This pattern is being repeated in other parts of the country.&quot;</p>
<p>More than 150,000 people -- mainly civilians -- have been killed in Burundi since 1993 in massacres and the vicious war between the Tutsi-dominated army and Hutu rebels.</p>
<p>Amnesty said massacres by government troops had been reported in rural Bujumbura, Muramvya, Kayanza and Cibitoke provinces.</p>
<p>It cited the case of the wife and four children, one three years old, of Honorata Murishu in Mahuta district near Bujumbura who were extrajudicially executed by troops on July 29.</p>
<p>It said in Mutimbuzi district 39 people were extrajudicially executed on August 9 after soldiers on August 7 with students killed more than 200 people in Rutegame district of Muramvya province.</p>
<p>&quot;The organisation is also concerned that all sides to the armed conflict are executing virtually all captured combatants,&quot; the Amnesty International statement said.</p>
<p>It said at least six prisoners on death row in Mpimba prison, Bujumbura, were moved to a secluded cell on August 9 and risked being subjected to torture in the next few days.</p>
<p>The transfer came a day after civil servants in Bujumbura demanded the public hanging of Hutu prisoners sentenced to death between February and June this year after unfair trials, it said.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite promises made by Major Buyoya that he would respect international law and stop refoulement (expulsion) of refugees, forcible repatriation has resumed,&quot; Amnesty International said.</p>
<p>It said troops were using torture and extrajudicial executions to frighten Rwandan refugees into returning home.</p>
<p>&quot;The army is making it clear that a similar fate awaits Rwandan refugees who remain in the camps. It appears Major Buyoya has either gone back on his word or is not in control of the forces which brought him to power,&quot; the group added.</p>
<p>Buyoya, who is trying to break down international opposition to the army coup, has pledged not to force Rwandan refugees in Burundi to return home and ordered a halt to forced expulsions by the Tutsi army earlier in July.</p>
