<headline>FOCUS - European markets hold fire for Bundesbank.</headline>

<p>European financial markets opened cautiously on Thursday as investors and traders waited to see which way the German central bank would jump on interest rates.</p>
<p>The region's biggest stock markets in London, Frankfurt and Paris were mixed in early trading, while the dollar held fast in a narrow range ahead of the Bundesbank decision.</p>
<p>The bank's policy-making council began its deliberations amid market speculation that it might cut a key money market rate or at least pave the way for a small move lower later.</p>
<p>The focus was on the securities repurchase rate, or repo, which the Bundesbank has held steady at 3.30 percent since February, despite lowering its official rates in mid-April.</p>
<p>Monetary data early in the week raised hopes of a repo cut, but prospects waned after the Ifo business climate index released on Wednesday indicated the economy was in better shape than many had thought.</p>
<p>&quot;Some clearly see the Ifo survey as strong enough to preclude an ease but it's worth noting that the index was above current levels when the Bundesbank cut the discount and repo rates last December,&quot; said Jeremy Hawkins, senior economic adviser at BankAmerica in London.</p>
<p>Analysts said the Bundesbank decision could provide an important signal to the market on the strength of the mark.</p>
<p>But one warned the Bundesbank could hurt other European currencies if it failed to move, with the Bank of France meeting at the same time as the German central bank.</p>
<p>By 0920 GMT the dollar was at 1.4841 marks and 108.27 yen compared with 1.4817 marks and 108.34 yen at the London close on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Unlike Frankfurt, British and french shares showed minor gains in early trading, with some short covering ahead of the central bank meetings.</p>
<p>The blue-chip CAC-40 index in Paris was up nearly five points, or 0.25 percent, at 2,005 at 0920 GMT.</p>
<p>London shares traded mixed around opening levels on the uncertainty about what Bundesbank would do and worries about the impact of U.S. legal cases on the tobacco industry.</p>
<p>B.A.T  fell 19p to 427p after Michigan became the 13th U.S. state to take the tobacco industry to court, filing a lawsuit seeking $14 billion in damages from major tobacco firms and their wholesale distributors.</p>
<p>The expectation that President Bill Clinton will approve regulation of tobacco as a drug by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration piled further pressure on shares.</p>
<p>After setting another trading high, the FTSE 100 shied away from the 3,900 level on Wednesday as the bond market weakness filtered through to stocks in the afternoon.</p>
<p>But good news from Germany may help set up the FTSE 100 for another run into record territory on Thursday.</p>
<p>The German DAX index was nearly four points lower after making small gains on the back of stable government bonds in pre-bourse trade.</p>
<p>Dealers said there were still hopes for small repo rate cut, but saw the risk that the market would fall irrespective of what the Bundesbank did.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 0920 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was at 1.4841 marks and 108.27 yen compared with 1.4817 marks and 108.34 yen at the London close on Wednesday.</p>
<p>STOCK MARKETS AT 0920 GMT</p>
<p>LONDON - The FTSE 100 index was up 1.1 points at 3,873.2.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT - The 30-share Dax index was down 4.21 points at 2,539.53.</p>
<p>PARIS - The CAC-40 inded was up 4.98 points at 2,005.62.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold opened easier at $386.90 against $387.25 with dealers expecting the easier trend to continue. Silver was a cent easier at 519 cents.</p>
