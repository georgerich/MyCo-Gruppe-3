<headline>Food, petrol shares dominate Nigerian bourse.</headline>

<p>Food and petrol marketing company shares were judged the best performing shares of the week on the Nigerian stock exchange by the close on Friday and looked set to continue their run into next week, traders said.</p>
<p>The all-share index closed at 6075.96, up from 6,068.92 on Thursday. Over the week the all-share index gained 0.85 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Investors like to stay with stocks they are sure of and the food sector has been a consistent good performer,&quot; one trader said.  </p>
<p>Flour Mills of Nigeria closed 16 kobo higher at 11.06 naira. Cadbury and Union Dicon Salt were up 10 kobo apiece, ending 22.70 naira and 32.82 naira, respectively.</p>
<p>After a slack period, triggered by a series of poorer than expected results, oil shares are once again marching upwards.</p>
<p>&quot;The fact that, despite the poorer results, there is still strong interest in the shares shows just how secure investors believe these companies to be,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>National Oil was 13 kobo up at 25.28 naira, while Unipetrol gained 10 kobo to 32.80 naira, the same amount as Mobil, which finished at 34.90 naira.</p>
<p>A lack of interest saw Vitafoam, First Aluminium and some packaging companies fall.</p>
<p>Vitafoam fell 10 kobo to end at 5.40 naira. First Aluminium lost five kobo to 5.40 naira. Studio Press was four kobo down at 1.40 naira, while Delta Glass finished at 6.30 naira, down two kobo.</p>
<p>&quot;The country's economic difficulties are hurting these businesses more than, say, food companies,&quot; one trader said.</p>
