<p>Australia said on Friday it was determined not to let India's veto kill a worldwide nuclear test ban treaty and vowed to lead a push for a United Nations resolution to keep the dream of a global pact alive.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said Canberra had launched a campaign at the United Nations to revive the draft Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), after a disarmament conference failed to agree on a text in the face of Indian opposition.</p>
<p>&quot;What we don't want to do is let the CTBT die,&quot; Downer told a news conference during a visit to Beijing on Friday. &quot;An enormous amount of effort has gone into it, there has been a very wide measure of agreement on the text.</p>
<p>&quot;We think the best way to take it forward is for us to ... take a resolution to the United Nations General Assembly in support of that text,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Government officials in Canberra said Australia would lead the charge to win agreement for the treaty and would look for co-sponsors for a U.N. resolution to allow it to be opened for signing despite the failure to reach a consensus.</p>
<p>&quot;We will work to achieve the treaty's endorsement during the current session of the U.N. General Assembly and its opening for signature at the earliest possible date,&quot; Downer said in a statement released in Canberra.</p>
<p>The 61-nation Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, which needed a unanimous stance to allow it to approve a draft text, on Thursday decided it could not even agree to report its failure to the General Assembly.</p>
<p>New Delhi, which had demanded nuclear powers commit themselves to move towards total disarmament, was able to block the treaty's progress singlehandedly -- prompting calls for a new way to be found to keep it alive.</p>
<p>Diplomats have said there is little time left for the 51st General Assembly to open the pact for signature at a ceremony in late September.</p>
<p>Australian ambassador for disarmament Richard Starr told Reuters in Geneva that Canberra still believed the treaty could be salvaged after nearly three years of negotiation and &quot;decades of expectations&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a clear need for friends of the CTBT to consider action so that the whole international community will be able to consider, endorse and sign this valuable treaty,&quot; Starr said.</p>
<p>&quot;We would not want to see a treaty text die in a pigeonhole in Geneva,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Australia, using its standing as a middle-ranking, non-nuclear power, has sought to play a leading role in the campaign to end nuclear testing.</p>
<p>Diplomats in Geneva said earlier this week the five declared nuclear powers -- Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States -- considered Australia best placed to present the draft treaty to the UN general assembly in the form of a resolution calling for a swift signing ceremony.</p>
<p>Downer said there was still some way to go to ensure the treaty's survival but expressed optimism a resolution would find widespread support.</p>
<p>&quot;This is just the beginning of a process,&quot; he said. &quot;I think there will be very strong support for our move.&quot;</p>
