<p>CBOT wheat futures closed lower on diminished fears about frost damage to the Canadian wheat crop and on concern about prospects for sales of soft red winter wheat to Egypt, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;They're downplaying the threat of frost next week in Canada and that's weighing on wheat,&quot; said Vic Lespinasse of Dean Witter Reynolds.</p>
<p>Meteorologists cited a diminished possibility of frost next week in Canada's spring wheat areas. The market was boosted Monday on concern about outlooks for freezing temperatures next week, the traders said.</p>
<p>An Environment Canada meteorologist said Tuesday there was a slight risk of frost damage to Canadian grain in the foothills of Alberta on Wednesday morning and along the Saskatchewan/Manitoba border on Thursday.</p>
<p>Traders also cited Egypt's purchase over the weekend of U.S. white wheat rather than soft red winter as a bearish market factor.</p>
<p>&quot;Egypt may not accept any more soft red wheat because of vomitoxin,&quot; said Ron Kucha of O'Connor and Co.</p>
<p>Wheat closed two to five cents per bushel lower, with September down five at $4.54-1/2.</p>
<p>Wheat was underpinned by concerns about potential rain-delayed harvest of the U.S. spring wheat crop and a decline in the condition rating for North Dakota's crop. USDA Monday said North Dakota wheat was 60 percent good to excellent, down from 63 percent the previous week.</p>
<p>Wheat futures volume was estimated at 16,000, down from 18,599 Monday.</p>
<p>Wheat options trading was relatively quiet with volume estimated at 6,000, up from 3,747 Monday.</p>
