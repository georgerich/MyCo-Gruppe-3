<p>An increase in purchasing power and consumption from a bigger-than-expected Finnish 1997 income tax cut will not boost inflation and the central bank should have no need to hike rates for at least a year, economists say.</p>
<p>The government's state budget proposal agreed last week includes income tax reductions worth 5.5 billion markka, and economists have been quick to upgrade consumption forecasts.</p>
<p>&quot;But in the short term one would need a lot of imagination to come up with something that would constitute an inflation threat,&quot; said economist Risto Murto at brokerage Selin Finance.</p>
<p>&quot;During the course of 1997, I see no possibility whatsoever for a need to arise to tighten monetary policy,&quot; said Mikael Ingberg, head of research at the Pellervo Institute for Economic Research (PTT).</p>
<p>Three of four economists polled by Reuters on Wednesday said it would take at least a year, and maybe 18 or even 24 months, before the Bank of Finland could conceivably see its core inflation target threatened.</p>
<p>But Petteri Hirvonen, economist at brokerage Davy Protos said the Bank might judge that inflation could start accelerating sometime during the second half of 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;There is so far no risk in that direction, but in early 1997 it is already possible that (the Bank) ... thinks it should take action to pre-empt a rise (in inflation) otherwise setting in half a year later,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But the majority view was that neither headline inflation nor the underlying inflation rate monitored by the central bank would pick up noticeably for quite some time.</p>
<p>In its most recent detailed statement on inflation prospects, the Bank of Finland on June 17 said: &quot;The conditions for a moderate inflation development over the next few years are favourable.</p>
<p>&quot;This in turn creates good conditions for interest rates to remain steady,&quot; it said. On July 5, the central bank lowered the tender rate to 3.50 percent from 3.60 percent and said the outlook was unchanged from June.</p>
<p>For the foreseeable future the tender rate -- the Bank's chief monetary policy tool -- was likely to remain at the current 3.50 percent or fall slightly, the economists said.</p>
<p>&quot;The monetary policy outlook is for a prolonged period of calm,&quot; Ingberg said.</p>
<p>&quot;A rise in interest rates may be in sight one or two years from now,&quot; Murto said.</p>
<p>Jukka Kero, economist at the Central Chamber of Commerce, said the Bank should make it clear to a broader audience than the financial markets that there was no upward pressure on interst rates.</p>
<p>&quot;I would regard (a hike) as a precipitate measure, absurdly overestimating the (inflation) risk if it happened within one year,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;They should make it clear, at least implicitly as the German Bundesbank seems to have been doing, that the tender rate will remain unchanged for a long time or that any possible move would be downwards,&quot; Kero said.</p>
<p>Partly due to the income tax cuts promised by the government, many private consumption forecasts for 1997 have been lifted to three percent from around 2.5 percent earlier.</p>
<p>Finland's biggest trade union group, the 1.1-million mainly blue-collar member Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions (SAK), said in a statement on Tuesday that purchasing power of a typical SAK member family would rise three percent next year.</p>
<p>Economists said strengthening private consumption would continue to focus on durables and semi-durables like cars, white goods and other household appliances. Home electronics sales, home refurbishing and tourism and foreign travel would increase.</p>
<p>This meant imports would rise, but not in a way that would threaten Finland's current account surplus, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are on very solid ground,&quot; said Ingberg at PTT. The annual C/A surplus widely forecast at around 20 billion markka at least until 1998 corresponded to nearly four percent of gross domestic product, he noted.</p>
<p>&quot;It is difficult to see such growth in imports that it woulds pose a real problem for the external balance and economic policy,&quot; he said.</p>
