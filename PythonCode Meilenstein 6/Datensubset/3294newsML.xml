<p>President Boris Yeltsin headed for the western Russian city of Valdai on Tuesday for a two-day break outside Moscow, the presidential press service said.  </p>
<p>&quot;It is expected that Boris Yeltsin will return to Moscow this week where he will hold a series of meetings with members of the government,&quot; a spokesman said. He gave no further details.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, 65, has not made any public appearances since his inauguration ceremony on August 9. Aides say he suffered &quot;colossal weariness&quot; after his re-election campaign, but they deny he has suffered new heart trouble.</p>
<p>The president had been expected to start a holiday outside Moscow and Valdai, about 350 km (220 miles) northwest of the capital, had been mentioned by aides as a possible destination.</p>
<p>Interfax news agency quoted presidential press secretary Sergei Yastrzhembsky as saying Yeltsin would fly to Valdai &quot;to see whether it is possible to spend a routine holiday there&quot;.</p>
