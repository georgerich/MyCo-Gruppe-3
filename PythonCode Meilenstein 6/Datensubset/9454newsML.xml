<p>Israeli-PLO relations reached crisis point on Thursday, rocked by a flap over a West Bank flight by Yasser Arafat and a planned meeting between the Palestinian President and former Israeli leader Shimon Peres.</p>
<p>Israel angered Arafat by holding up for three hours permission to fly over its territory by helicopter to the West Bank town of Ramallah for a scheduled meeting with Peres.</p>
<p>Palestinians said Arafat cancelled an Israeli-PLO meeting on civilian affairs in protest and that the Palestinian leader would meet Peres later in the day in self-ruled Gaza.</p>
<p>Yossi Beilin, a former minister in Peres's cabinet, said the Labour party chief had every right to meet Arafat.</p>
<p>&quot;How can someone think he can stop the head of the opposition (Peres) from meeting Mr. Yasser Arafat? These are two people who brought about such great changes in the history of the region,&quot; Beilin told Israel Radio.</p>
<p>Ahmed Korei, speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council, said the council dedicated its morning session to discussion of &quot;Israel's flagrant violation of the accords by restricting President Arafat's movement&quot;.</p>
<p>Legislators accused Israel of trying to humiliate the Palestinians and of attempting to undermine deals signed with the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) in 1993.</p>
<p>&quot;This is an attempt by the Israeli government to impose a whole mentality of domination and humiliation on the Palestinian leadership, and has serious political implications,&quot; Minister of Higher Education Hanan Ashrawi told Reuters.</p>
<p>She added: &quot;If (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu wants to renege on agreements, this is clearly one way he's doing it.&quot;</p>
<p>Netanyahu's election last May dismayed Palestinians, who won limited self-rule on the West Bank and Gaza and a promise from the former Labour government to negotiate a final peace.</p>
<p>Arafat risked his political life by signing the historic interim PLO-Israel peace deal. Some Palestinians said the accord was a sellout.</p>
<p>Netanyahu opposes trading occupied land for peace and has so far refused to meet Arafat. The right-wing leader has yet to carry out a redeployment of Israeli troops in the West Bank town of Hebron, part of a deal signed last September.</p>
<p>Final peace talks, begun before the May election, have yet to resume.</p>
<p>Netanyahu has accused Nobel peace laureate Peres of &quot;sticking spokes in the wheels of peace&quot; by meeting Arab leaders while in opposition.</p>
<p>Palestinian Planning Minister Nabil Shaath said an explosion was unavoidable if Israel kept up what he called violations and delays in implementing signed agreements.</p>
<p>Palestinian peace negotiator Hassan Asfour charged Netanyahu, who has accused Peres of trying to undermine his Likud government's authority, of personally barring Arafat's flight.</p>
<p>David Bar-Illan, Netanyahu's communications director, dismissed the accusation, saying technical problems rather than political ones had kept Arafat grounded in Gaza.</p>
<p>Bar-Illan blasted Peres, 73, over the Arafat meeting and suggested he retire from politics and accept an &quot;elder statesman's&quot; role if he wanted to continue his peace efforts.</p>
<p>Saeb Erekat, minister of local government in the Palestinian Authority, told Israel's army radio: &quot;We thought after all Israel was a democracy and when Netanyahu won the elections he doesn't cancel the fact there are many political parties in Israel.&quot;</p>
