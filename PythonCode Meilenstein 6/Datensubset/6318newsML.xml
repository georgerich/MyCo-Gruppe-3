<p>Suspected Moslem militants shot dead two Coptic Christian brothers and wounded another man in southern Egypt on Wednesday, security sources said.</p>
<p>They said the gunmen escaped after shooting farmer Redha Wahib Ayoub, 35, and brother Ayoub, 25, while they were on their way home from the fields in Qalandul village near Mallawi, about 260 km (160 miles) south of Cairo.</p>
<p>In another village, gunmen also shot and critically wounded farmer Mukthar Hana Mikhail earlier on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The sources said the gunmen, suspected members of the militant al-Gama'a al-Islamiya (Islamic Group), thought the three men were police informers.</p>
<p>The Gama'a is the largest militant group fighting since 1992 to overthrow the government and set up a strict Islamic state in Egypt. They have targetted Christians, tourists and police officers during their armed campaign.</p>
<p>Mallawi, in the Minya province, has been the centre of most of the political violence in Egypt for the past two years.</p>
<p>Nearly 1,000 people, mainly police and militants, have been killed in the four-year-old violence.</p>
<p>Armed civilians are now allowed to participate in patrols with the security forces in southern provinces to fight against militants, the sources said.</p>
