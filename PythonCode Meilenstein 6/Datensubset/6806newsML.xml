<p>Israeli intelligence agencies are increasingly concerned that Syria may opt for war to break a deadlock in peace talks, a senior legislator said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Hagai Merom of the opposition Labour party told Israel Radio he planned to ask for an urgent special session of parliament to discuss what he called a &quot;grave and worrisome&quot; situation.</p>
<p>Merom, chairman of parliament's Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee under the last Labour-led government, said he could not accept Likud Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's attempts to play down recent tensions with Syria.</p>
<p>&quot;I have heard recently that all Israeli intelligence elements are very carefully examining Syria through a magnifying glass and listening to every noise sounded there,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;From the way things look and sound, the possibility that a war option is being considered (by Syria) as realistic has deepened.&quot;</p>
<p>In an interview with Israeli Army Radio, Merom said: &quot;Assessments are growing within Military Intelligence that there is a possibility of war with Syria.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We must not wake up one morning to a new Yom Kippur,&quot; Merom said, referring to the surprise Egyptian and Syrian attacks that launched the 1973 Middle East war on the Jewish Day of Atonement.</p>
<p>Tension has mounted between Israel and Syria since Netanyahu took office in June vowing to retain the occupied Golan Heights. Israeli-Syrian peace talks have been deadlocked over the Golan issue since 1991.</p>
<p>Netanyahu's predecessor Shimon Peres, while giving no firm commitment to quit all of the Golan, said he could not envisage Syria making peace without regaining the territory.</p>
<p>&quot;We must open our eyes. This diplomatic deadlock is very dangerous. Syria and Iran already have a new approach and Iran has taken a much more central role than when the Labour government was pushing the peace process forward,&quot; Merom said.</p>
<p>Syria's Prime Minister Mahmoud Zu'bi ended on Tuesday a four-day visit to Iran during which he met President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, who said the two countries must strengthen ties to face the United States and Israel.</p>
<p>Syria accused Israel on Wednesday of launching a hysterical campaign against it after Israeli Channel Two television reported on Monday that Damascus had recently test fired a Scud C missile able to hit most cities in the Jewish state.</p>
<p>Israel on Tuesday tested its U.S.-funded Arrow 2 missile, saying it successfully intercepted a target missile.</p>
<p>Netanyahu said Syria had been arming itself for years with Scuds and there was no change in the strategic balance, which military analysts consider to be in Israel's favour.</p>
<p>&quot;I view with gravity the attempts of officials in the opposition to create a campaign of fear as if Israel is in some sort of immediate, terrible danger -- as if something has changed in some sweeping way,&quot; Netanyahu said on Tuesday.</p>
