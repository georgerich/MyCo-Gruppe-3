<p>Syria on Tuesday accused Israel of beating the drums of war in the Middle East and warned Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he would be defeated in any military confrontation with Arabs.</p>
<p>&quot;Israel is no longer interested in making peace. It has retracted from all its peace process commitments and guarantees and returned to its traditional course of escalating tension, beating the drums of war and waving flagrant threats against Syria and Lebanon,&quot; the ruling party newspaper al-Baath said.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no doubt that Israel, after killing the peace process, will try to set off new wars in the region and exert pressures on Arabs who have rejected its plans,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Tension between Syria and Israel escalated after the Likud leader said he would not return the Golan Heights, captured from Syria in the Middle East war in 1967, adding further deadlock to the peace talks which have been staggering for over four years.</p>
<p>&quot;Israel should count to 100 and even 1,000 before it gets involved in such a foolish action because the world of today is not the one of yesterday and what was allowed then cannot go with the current international order,&quot; al-Baath said.</p>
<p>&quot;Defeat is the most likely possibility in any aggression Netanyahu's government might be thinking of,&quot; it added.</p>
