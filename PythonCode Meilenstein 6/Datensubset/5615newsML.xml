<p>NYMEX electricity futures settled higher in line with a rise in the price of physical deals, and with some strength from forecasts of hot weather for the West, industry sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;PV (Palo Verde) would be more weather related than COB (California-Oregon Border),&quot; said one New York-based electricity broker. &quot;It would be the effect of cash, and some paper came in buying the futures today.&quot;</p>
<p>September COB closed up 35 cents at $18.25 after trade as low as $17.65, while October ended 32 cents higher at $16.15 from trade as low as $15.60 per megawatt hour (MWh).</p>
<p>Remaining COB months, with the exception of August 1997, finished up between five and 50 cents.</p>
<p>September PV finished 14 cents higher at $21.04 from trade as low as $20.30, while October ended 10 cents higher at $16.20 from trade in a range of $16.00-16.30 per MWh.</p>
<p>Remaining PV deferreds finished steady to 10 cents higher.</p>
<p>Above-normal temperatures were forecast to dominate the western half of the U.S. through to August 29.</p>
<p>NYMEX said a total of 284 COB contracts and 70 PV contracts traded.</p>
