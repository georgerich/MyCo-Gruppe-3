<p>Three Afghan guards brought to the United Arab Emirates last week by Russian hostages who escaped from the Taleban militia will return to Afghanistan in a few days, the Afghan embassy in Abu Dhabi said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;Our ambassador is in touch with the UAE foreign ministry. Their return to Afghanistan will take place in two or three days,&quot; an embassy official said.</p>
<p>&quot;The embassy is issuing them travel documents for their return to their homeland. There is no objection to their travel,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The three Islamic Taleban guards were overpowered by seven Russian aircrew who escaped to UAE state Sharjah last Friday on board their own aircraft after a year in the captivity of Taleban militia in Kandahar in southern Afghanistan.</p>
<p>The UAE said on Monday it would hand over the three to the International Red Crescent, possibly last Tuesday. It has since been silent on the issue.</p>
<p>When asked whether the three guards would travel back to Kandahar or the Afghan capital Kabul, the embassy official said: &quot;That has not been decided, but possibly Kandahar.&quot;</p>
<p>Kandahar is the headquarters of the opposition Taleban militia. Kabul is controlled by President Burhanuddin Rabbani's government, which Taleban is fighting to overthrow.</p>
<p>The embassy official said the three men, believed to be in their 20s, were currently in Abu Dhabi. He did not elaborate.</p>
<p>The Russians, working for the Aerostan firm in the Russian republic of Tatarstan, were taken hostage after a Taleban MiG-19 fighter forced their cargo plane to land in August 1995.</p>
<p>Taleban said its shipment of ammunition from Albania was evidence of Russian military support for Rabbani's government. Moscow said the crew's nationality was coincidental.</p>
<p>Numerous diplomatic attempts to free the seven failed.</p>
<p>The Russians, who said they overpowered the guards -- two armed with Kalashnikov automatic rifles -- while doing regular maintenance work on their Ilyushin 76 cargo plane last Friday, left the UAE capital Abu Dhabi for home on Sunday.</p>
