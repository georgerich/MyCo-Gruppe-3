<p>New Zealand's Labour Cost Index rose by 0.3 percent in the June quarter and by 1.9 percent in the year to June, Statistics New Zealand said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Economists on average had expected rises of 0.53 percent and 2.2 percent respectively.</p>
<p>The 1.9 percent annual rise in salary and wage rates matches that for the years to December 1995 and March 1996.  </p>
<p>Base salary and ordinary time wage rates in all sectors were on average 2.0 percent higher than in June 1995. This was the same as the rise in the year to March but slightly higher than the rise of 1.9 percent for the year to December 1995.</p>
<p>Overtime wage rates rose 0.2 percent in the June quarter and 1.3 percent on an annual basis. This compared with a 0.5 percent rise in the March quarter and 1.2 percent in the March year.  </p>
<p>Industry group rises in salary and wage rates for the year ranged from 0.9 percent for forestry and logging up to 2.5 percent for manufacturing industry sub-groups, machinery and metal products, and non-metallic mineral products.</p>
<p>Manufacturing as a whole increased by 2.1 percent and the increase for construction, at 2.2 percent, was slightly lower than the 2.3 percent rises for the years to December 1995 and March 1996.</p>
<p>Increases were recorded in the year to June for all nine major occupational groups. -- Wellington newsroom 64 4 4734 746</p>
