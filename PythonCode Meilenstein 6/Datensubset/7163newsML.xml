<p>Dresden's Baroque Frauenkirche (Church of Our Lady) was set to host its first service since it was destroyed in a 1945 bombing raid with the inauguration of its restored crypt on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Once the centrepiece of the Baroque centre that earned Dresden the name &quot;Florence on the Elbe&quot;, the Frauenkirche was bombed on February 13, 1945, in a British and U.S. air assault that killed some 35,000 civilians. The church tower stood, a smoking shell, for days after the raid before collapsing.</p>
<p>&quot;The inauguration (of the crypt) should spur efforts to complete reconstruction on the whole church,&quot; said the Bishop of Saxony, Volker Kress, who was due to lead the service attended by about 300 clerics, regional and city officials.</p>
<p>Kress said he hoped the vaulted crypt, reconstructed from photographs, would inspire more donations. Restoration could cost a total of 250 million marks ($165 million) and take another 10 to 15 years.</p>
<p>But only 25 million marks have been raised so far, he said in a recent interview.</p>
<p>Guests at the ceremony included the premier of the regional state of Saxony, Kurt Biedenkopf, and other dignitaries who have supported the project, which got under way in 1993.</p>
<p>Britain's &quot;Dresden Trust&quot; and a U.S.-based foundation are also helping raise money for the project.</p>
<p>The inauguration marked the end of 50 years of debate over whether Dresden's famous Italianate church, which was completed in 1743, should be allowed to rise out of the ashes or be left as a permanent reminder of the futility of war.</p>
<p>&quot;For Dresdeners the Frauenkirche will remain a symbol for peace and reconciliation,&quot; said Matthias Oelke, a spokesman for the church. &quot;Once again the Frauenkirche will be the spiritual centre of Dresden,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The ruins always had symbolic significance. They became a meeting place for the then-East German peace movement that arose in the 1980s to oppose the Communist regime.</p>
<p>Protesters also gathered every year on February 13 to remember one of the most brutal air raids of the war and to demonstrate against the arms race. The tradition remained after German unification in 1990.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands carrying candles come to the church every year to call for peace and to listen to church bells that chime the hour the first bombs fell at 9:45 p.m. Dresden, previously untouched by the allied bombing campaign, was bombed for several days, by American aircraft at night and British by day.</p>
