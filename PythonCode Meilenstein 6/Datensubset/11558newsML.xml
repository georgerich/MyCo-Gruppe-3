<p>Nepali police said on Friday they arrested a man who allegedly kept a child servant bound in chains so that he would not run away when his employer was out to work.</p>
<p>Madhusudan Munakarmi was arrested on Thursday after his neighbours informed police about the plight of 12-year old Dhiraj K.C., who told police his employer used to tie him up with iron chains and locks concealed under his clothes.</p>
<p>The neighbours in Kathmandu called the police when they saw Dheeraj, employed by the man for the past nine months, limping because of the chains.</p>
<p>&quot;I feared he would flee from work or steal my belongings,&quot; the Kathmandu Post newspaper quoted Munakarmi as saying after his arrest. If convicted, he faces a maximum of three years in jail under Nepal's child protection laws.</p>
