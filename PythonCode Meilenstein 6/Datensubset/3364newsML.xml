<p>Daredevil Frenchman Alain &quot;Spiderman&quot; Robert, famous for scaling tall buildings around the world, was arrested on Tuesday as he attempted to climb a 35-floor building in Rio de Janeiro, police said.</p>
<p>Robert had reached the fifth floor of the building in Rio's Barra da Tijuca beachfront neighbourhood when security guards stopped him, a police spokesman said.</p>
<p>O Globo television showed Robert slipping away from the guards when they led him out of the building, which is still under construction. He then made another bid to scale the towering structure.</p>
<p>Police finally arrived and arrested him. The Frenchman was charged with disturbing the peace and was to appear in court on Sept. 3. He could be jailed for two months if found guilty.</p>
<p>It was his second attempt at climbing a landmark building in Rio in the last three days. He successfully scaled a 38-floor building on Sunday in the city centre.</p>
<p>Robert, a father of three, began mountain climbing in the Alps 20 years ago and in 1994 decided to tackle man-made structures without any equipment, safety belts or ropes.</p>
<p>His exploits to date include New York's Brooklyn Bridge, San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge, London's Canary Wharf and the Tour de Montparnasse in Paris.</p>
