<title>SLOVENIA: Slovenian shares slip, seen steady.</title>
<headline>Slovenian shares slip, seen steady.</headline>

<p>Slovenian shares eased 0.24 percent on Thursday and traders said they expected the market to show little movement until the end of August.</p>
<p>&quot;Prices are generally considered to be low but at the same time most investors, who have been pulling out since March, haven't yet gained enough confidence to return,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>The market went into a freefall in March after the Securities Market Agency moved to prohibit the nation's largest mutual fund Proficia Dadas from trading, accusing it of illegal trade practices.</p>
<p>Since then the SBI index has lost 33.5 percent, while shares of financial consultancy Dadas, which owns Proficia Dadas, have plunged 86.4 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe the market may lure investors back in the autumn, when new listings of newly privatised companies are expected,&quot; another broker said.</p>
<p>The bourse said up to 15 listings of newly privatised companies could be expected by the end of the year.</p>
<p>* The seven-share SBI index fell 2.32 points to 980.60.</p>
<p>* Six shares fell and five rose, while 12 were untraded.</p>
<p>* Turnover rose to 86.8 million tolars from 43 million.</p>
<p>* Financial consultancy Dadas had the highest turnover, easing 1.85 percent to 33,028 tolars on volume of 1,302 shares for total turnover of 43 million tolars.</p>
<p>* Ordinary shares of bank Dolenjska banka were the leading decliners, shedding 2.05 percent to 10,692 tolars on volume of 65 shares for total turnover of 695,000 tolars.</p>
<p>* Food producer Droga was the biggest gainer, adding on 3.11 percent to 15,423 tolars on volume of 1,959 shares for total turnover of 30.2 million tolars. -- Novica Mihajlovic, Ljubljana newsroom, 386-61-125-8439</p>
