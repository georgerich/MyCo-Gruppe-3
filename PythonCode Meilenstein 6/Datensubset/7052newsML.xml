<title>USA: Man gets life for cookie theft in Florida.</title>
<headline>Man gets life for cookie theft in Florida.</headline>
<dateline>TAMPA, Fla 1996-08-20</dateline>
<text>
<p>A man who robbed a Girl Scout and her mother of money and a box of cookies was sentenced on Tuesday to life in prison.</p>
<p>Circuit Court Judge Bob Mitcham handed Cleveland Johnson, 29, a life sentence as a habitual offender and gave his accomplice, John Pellicer, 20, an 8 1/2 year term.</p>
<p>The two robbed 8-year-old Lisa Ranon at gunpoint outside a Tampa supermarket on March 22, stealing less than $100 and a box of cookies.</p>
<p>While Pellicer had only a single misdemeanor on his record, Johnson had a long criminal record and had served prison time before, said assistant state attorney Melvin Luntz said.</p>
<p>He said that changes in Florida law now mean that inmates must serve at least 80 percent of their sentences.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Johnson will spend most of his life in prison,&quot; Luntz said.</p>
<p>The two men apologised in court for the robbery, which Mitcham called &quot;despicable.&quot;</p>
<p>Johnson's lawyer said his client is mentally retarded and needed help.</p>
