<p>The Trocadero entertainment complex in the heart of London's Piccadilly marked its relaunch on Tuesday after a 50 million pound ($77 million) redevelopment that it said was expected to triple revenues over five years.</p>
<p>&quot;An estimated 55 million visitors a year pass by the Trocadero and some 20 million people come through the centre,&quot; Nick Leslau, chief executive of Trocadero Plc, told a news conference.</p>
<p>The challenge, he said, was to convert visitors into money-spending consumers.</p>
<p>Leslau said he expected the retail revenues to triple over the next five years, the time span in which he expects the centre to reach maturity.</p>
<p>He said Trocadero would seek to convert rental agreements into revenue-sharing deals as leases expire.</p>
<p>Trocadero and Japan's Sega together invested about $77 million in redesigning the centre -- shifting its focus from shopping to entertainment and giving it a flashy, high-tech look -- and installing a SegaWorld virtual reality centre due to open next month.</p>
<p>An Imax 3D cinema is to open in early 1997.</p>
<p>The complex's current entertainment and shopping tenants -- including cinemas, an amusement arcade and a Planet Hollywood restaurant as well as shops -- generate retail revenues of about 125 million pounds ($192 million) a year, Leslau said. Trocadero derives its revenues from the rental income it receives from these tenants.</p>
<p>It recently entered into a joint venture for a Marvel Mania themed restaurant to be built adjacent to the Trocadero. The Marvel Mania restaurant, based on characters from Marvel comics, is a joint venture with Robert Earl's Planet Hollywood and Ronald Perelman's Marvel Entertainment Group Inc.</p>
<p>Trocadero's current rental deals provide guaranteed income that is sufficient to cover the complex's service debt and overhead for the next 22 years, Leslau said.</p>
<p>Trocadero Plc was spun off from property management group Burford Holdings last November. Burford had acquired the Trocadero complex in September 1994 for 94 million pounds ($145 million). At that time the Trocadero was a shopping mall.</p>
<p>&quot;The key to success at the Trocadero lay in its transformation from a shopping mall into a premier entertainment destination,&quot; Leslau added.</p>
