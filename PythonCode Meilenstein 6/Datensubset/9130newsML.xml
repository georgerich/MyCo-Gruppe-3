<p>Grozny, pounded by Russian forces on Wednesday, was quiet early on Thursday as residents waited to see if peacemaker Alexander Lebed could deliver on his promise to halt a threatened all-out assault.</p>
<p>The sound of explosions occasionally echoed across the countryside around the city, but they were far fewer than on Wednesday, when artillery bombardments went on for hours.</p>
<p>A couple of helicopters flew overhead, but did not appear to be firing and there was no sign of the fighter jets which screamed over the city on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Lebed, sent by President Boris Yeltsin to bring peace to Chechnya, said after talks with Chechen separatists that he had agreed a ceasefire with the commander of the rebels who seized most of Grozny more than two weeks ago.</p>
<p>Interfax news agency, quoting the Russian commandant in Chechnya, said both Russian and Chechen forces had ceased military actions.</p>
<p>&quot;The situation was normal in the town throughout the night,&quot; Partagen Andrievsky told the agency. He said rebels had fired on Russian positions 10 times and 12 servicemen had been injured.</p>
<p>The Russian military, humiliated by the separatists' takeover of Grozny, had accused them of using a previous ceasefire to strengthen their positions, and military commanders had told civilians to leave the city because they would bomb the rebels out of it.</p>
<p>But Lebed assured Chechen chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov late on Wednesday that the Russian generals' ultimatum was &quot;a bad joke&quot; and said there would be no bombing.</p>
<p>&quot;Lebed gave a guarantee that there would be no storming of Grozny tomorrow nor in the future,&quot; Maskhadov told Reuters correspondent Dmitry Kuznets after late-night talks with Lebed in the village of Novye Atagi, 20 km (12 miles) from Grozny.</p>
<p>&quot;I have taken it upon myself never again to give the Chechen side ultimatums,&quot; said Lebed, telling local people who gathered around that he would strive to justify their trust.</p>
<p>The two men are due to meet again at 10 a.m. (0600 GMT).</p>
<p>Ceasefires have come and gone in 20 months of war in Chechnya. And with Russia's chain of command looking more than usually tangled over the past few days, it will be some hours before Grozny can be sure that Lebed is as good as his word.</p>
<p>Asked about his tug-of-war with the generals, Lebed was quoted as saying: &quot;No one has given anyone any powers. You simply have to take it, as I am quietly doing.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to restore a single command structure.&quot;</p>
<p>Frightened civilians have already fled the city, much of it still in ruins after Russian raids at the start of Russia's military campaign to crush Chechnya's independence bid.</p>
<p>Those still in the city, huddled in cellars without power, water or food, have appealed to the outside world for help.</p>
<p>The Red Cross estimated there were now about 120,000 civilians in the city after a similar number fled the past fortnight's fighting.</p>
<p>The acting Russian commander in the region made his threat of an all-out bombardment on Monday. He accused the rebels of abusing a shaky truce agreed last week with Lebed's help and gave civilians 48 hours to Thursday morning to flee their homes.</p>
<p>His superior, General Vyacheslav Tikhomirov, returned from holiday and sounded equally bellicose on Wednesday. Tikhomirov met Lebed before he headed off for his talks with Maskhadov.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, as commander-in-chief of Russia's armed forces, is in overall command of the Chechnya campaign, Moscow's biggest military engagement since the Afghan war.</p>
<p>But at his only public appearance in seven weeks, his August 9 inauguration, he looked stiff and tired. Aides say he is resting and have denied reports he has suffered a recurrence of heart trouble.</p>
<p>U.S. President Bill Clinton appealed to Yeltsin on Wednesday to end violence in Chechnya and promote a peaceful dialogue.</p>
<p>&quot;This cycle of violence must come to an end because prolonged fighting is only going to endanger civilians,&quot; White House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters, quoting a letter from Clinton to Yeltsin.</p>
