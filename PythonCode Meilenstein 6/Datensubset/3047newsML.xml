<p>London robusta coffee futures ended mixed after choppy trade steered by New York but outright volume was weak, traders said.</p>
<p>A large pile of coffee stocks pending approval at New York's Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange caused little concern after two subsequent drops in certified stocks.</p>
<p>News that a hefty 19,000 bags of coffee were awaiting Exchange certification exerted some pressure on the key Sept/Dec switch early in the session but the market then firmed.</p>
<p>Traders said while the September premium held it could continue to attract coffee for delivery.</p>
<p>But two days before the New York delivery period begins, the open position remained well above certified stocks. London delivery begins on September 1.</p>
<p>In London, the second-month benchmark November ended $4 lower at $1,653 a tonne after trading between $1,640 and $1,665. September closed up $3 at $1,680 and volume totalled 5,283 lots including large AA volume on September.</p>
<p>The Sept/Nov spread was trading at $20-25 in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Traders noted scale-up selling although neither origins nor industry were cited. Funds were also sidelined.</p>
<p>The consolidation was seen in line with technical signals which suggested a need to correct overbought RSI levels after last week's rally. But analysts expect the upward trend to resume.</p>
