<p>Engineering and pharmaceuticals trading group Internatio-Mueller NV said on Thursday it expected to post a clear profit rise in the second half of 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;The board expects the second half of 1996 to show a clearly higher net profit than in the same period of 1995,&quot; the company said in a statement.</p>
<p>Internatio said in March it expected the 1996 full-year net profit to at least equal 1995's 85.1 million guilders.  </p>
<p>The company's first-half net profit rose by 12 percent to 45.2 million guilders despite a higher tax burden. It paid 14.5 million guilders in taxes, compared with nine million in the first half of 1995.</p>
<p>Internatio said its technical subsidiaries in particular had contributed to the profit rise but its pharmaceuticals unit Interpharm Groep had also substantially increased its results.</p>
<p>Negative impact of government price rulings for prescription drugs in the Netherlands had been offset by Interpharm's increasing market share and a strict cost cutting policy, the company said.  </p>
<p>Partly because of takeovers, Internatio's technical and chemical trading unit posted higher first-half profits but it said its port activities were negatively affected by the current price war in the sea cargo sector.</p>
<p>Internatio said it would strengthen the organisational structure of its port activities and would gradually increase the number of its offices in northwest European ports.</p>
