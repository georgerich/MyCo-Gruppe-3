<p>Werner Dieter, former chief executive of Mannesmann AG, said he would seek legal advice before deciding whether to accept a deal offered by prosecutors.</p>
<p>In an interview with the newspaper Boersen Zeitung published on Tuesday, Dieter said he had not yet received the prosecutors' offer directly, but had only learned of it through news media.</p>
<p>According to the reports, prosecutors offered to drop their investigation against Dieter, who stepped down as management board chief in July 1994, if he agreed to pay a fine of one million marks ($671,000). He is suspected of having steered Mannesmann contracts to a family-run company.</p>
