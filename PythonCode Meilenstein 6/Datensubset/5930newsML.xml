<p>Russian forces pounded the Chechen capital Grozny on Wednesday even as confusion reigned over Kremlin policy.</p>
<p>Civilians trapped in Grozny pleaded for help from the outside world, but planes flew over the city and the huge explosions area heard in their wake seemed to signal the start of long-expected air raids to drive out separatists who captured the city over two weeks ago.</p>
<p>Much of Grozny is still in ruins from Russian raids at the start of Moscow's 20-month military campaign to crush Chechnya's independence bid.</p>
<p>A second devastation seemed imminent, even though Defence Minister Igor Rodionov dismissed an ultimatum by Russia's deputy military commander in the region for people to quit Grozny or face massive bombing raids.</p>
<p>General Konstantin Pulikovsky had been reprimanded for his actions, Rodionov was reported as saying in the southern Russian city of Volgograd.</p>
<p>Itar-Tass news agency quoted Rodionov saying he had &quot;nothing to do&quot; with Pulikovsky's statement on Monday that he would bomb the Grozny from Thursday morning to dislodge the rebels.</p>
<p>The comments highlighted the complete confusion over Russia's policy in the breakaway province in the absence of President Boris Yeltsin.</p>
<p>Aides say Yeltsin is taking a short break in the lakelands of northwest Russia and Interfax news agency said he was returning to Moscow on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The military in Chechnya, humiliated by the separatists' August 6 raid on Grozny and subsequent fighting in which hundreds were killed, seems determined to use whatever it takes to crush the guerrillas' resistance.</p>
<p>Yeltsin's security chief Alexander Lebed, appointed just two months ago, wants to use peaceful means resolve the conflict, in which tens of thousands of people have already been killed.</p>
<p>Lebed travelled to Chechnya on Wednesday for his third visit in just over a week. He is due to meet Russian generals and then travel to meet rebel leaders in the village of Novye Atagi, some 20 km (12 miles) to the south of Grozny.</p>
<p>&quot;(Lebed) is aiming at a more complicated way of resolving the situation in Chechnya -- a peaceful one and not a battle for one town or another,&quot; Interfax news agency quoted Lebed's spokesman Alexander Barkhatov as saying.</p>
<p>RIA news agency, quoting the head of the military prosecutor's office in Chechnya, said 420 Russian servicemen had been killed and 1,300 had been wounded in the latest fighting for the control of Grozny, once a city of 400,000 people.</p>
<p>Civilians trapped in cellars, fearing carpet bombing from Russian forces, pleaded for help from the outside world and said they felt they had been abandoned in their own country.</p>
<p>&quot;In houses number seven and nine along Ulitsa Pobedy (Victory Street) there are many citizens, among them children, women, and elderly people, who have spent eight days in the basements of their houses,&quot; said an appeal, written on a flimsy sheet of paper and handed to foreign journalists as a plea to the outside world.</p>
<p>&quot;Our houses are bombarded continuously from heavy weaponry. We are in a desperate state, without bread, water, or light. There are no fighters in our houses, no soldiers, and no one is firing from them, but the bombardment never stops.</p>
<p>&quot;We are living in uncertainty and confusion, we feel that we have been abandoned in our own country. We ask that you do everything possible to stop this war.&quot;</p>
<p>The United States and Germany have condemned the threat of bombing raids and urged Russia to halt its Chechnya campaign.</p>
<p>&quot;It should be clear to the parties involved that after 20 months of conflict the dispute there cannot be resolved by use of force,&quot; U.S. State Department spokesman Glyn Davies said.</p>
<p>&quot;There has to be an element of negotiation.&quot;</p>
<p>The German Foreign Ministry said political director Wolfgang Ischinger had made Bonn's desire for a peaceful settlement in Chechnya clear to Russian officials.</p>
<p>&quot;The political director stressed our great concern about current developments...He stressed the necessity of a peaceful solution that involves the OSCE (Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe) and underscored our call to refrain from further military action,&quot; a statement said.</p>
<p>OSCE mediators abandoned their central Grozny office on Wednesday in anticipation of the threatened bombing.</p>
