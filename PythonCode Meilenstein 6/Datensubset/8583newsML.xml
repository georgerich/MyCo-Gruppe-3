<headline>BASEBALL-GREER HOMER IN 10TH LIFTS TEXAS PAST INDIANS.</headline>
<dateline>CLEVELAND 1996-08-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>Rusty Greer's two-run homer in the top of the 10th inning rallied the Texas Rangers to a 10-8 victory over the Cleveland Indians Wednesday in the rubber game of a three-game series between division leaders.</p>
<p>With one out, Greer hit a 1-1 pitch from Julian Tavarez (4-7) over the right-field fence for his 15th home run.</p>
<p>&quot;It was an off-speed pitch and I just tried to get a good swing on it and put it in play,&quot; Greer said. &quot;This was a big game. The crowd was behind him and it was intense.&quot;</p>
<p>The shot brought home Ivan Rodriguez, who had his second double of the game, giving him 42 this season, 41 as a catcher. He joined Mickey Cochrane, Johnny Bench and Terry Kennedy as the only catchers with 40 doubles in a season.</p>
<p>The Rangers have won 10 of their last 12 games and six of nine meetings against the Indians this season. The American League Western leaders have won eight of 15 games at Jacobs Field, joining the Yankees as the only teams with a winning record at the A.L. Central leaders' home.</p>
<p>Cleveland lost for just the second time in six games.</p>
<p>The Indians sent the game into extra innings in the ninth on Kenny Lofton's two-run single.</p>
<p>Ed Vosberg (1-0) blew his first save opportunity but got the win, allowing three hits with two walks and three strikeouts in 1 2/3 scoreless innings.</p>
<p>Dean Palmer hit his 30th homer for the Rangers.</p>
<p>In Baltimore, Cal Ripken had four hits and snapped a fifth-inning tie with a solo homer and Bobby Bonilla added a three-run shot in the seventh to power the surging Orioles to a 10-5 victory over the Seattle Mariners.</p>
<p>The Mariners scored four runs in the top of the fifth to tie the game 5-5 but Ripken led off the bottom of the inning with his 21st homer off starter Sterling Hitchcock (12-6).</p>
<p>Bonilla's blast was the first time Randy Johnson, last season's Cy Young winner, allowed a run in five relief appearances since coming off the disabled list on August 6. Bonilla has 21 RBI and 15 runs in his last 20 games.</p>
<p>Baltimore has won seven of nine and 16 of its last 22 and cut the Yankees' lead in the A.L. East to five games.</p>
<p>Scott Erickson (8-10) laboured to his third straight win.</p>
<p>Alex Rodriguez had two homers and four RBI for the Mariners, who have dropped three in a row and 11 of 15. He became the fifth shortstop in major-league history to hit 30 homers in a season and the first since Ripken hit 34 in 1991.</p>
<p>Chris Hoiles hit his 22nd homer for Baltimore.</p>
<p>In New York, Jason Dickson scattered 10 hits over 6 1/3 innings in his major-league debut and Chili Davis belted a homer from each side of the plate as the California Angels defeated the Yankees 7-1.</p>
<p>Dickson allowed a homer to Derek Jeter on his first major-league pitch but settled down. He was the 27th pitcher used by the Angels this season, tying a major-league record.</p>
<p>Jimmy Key (9-10) took the loss as the Yankees lost their ninth in 14 games. They stranded 11 baserunners.</p>
<p>California played without interim manager John McNamara, who was admitted to a New York hospital with a blood clot in his right calf.</p>
<p>In Boston, Mike Stanley's bases-loaded two-run single snapped an eighth-inning tie and gave the Red Sox their third straight win, 6-4 over the Oakland Athletics.</p>
<p>Stanley owns a .367 career batting average with the bases loaded (33-for-90).</p>
<p>Boston's Mo Vaughn went 3-for-3 with a walk, stole home for one of his three runs scored and collected his 116th RBI.</p>
<p>Scott Brosius homered and drove in two runs for the Athletics, who have lost seven of their last nine games.</p>
<p>In Detroit, Brad Ausmus's three-run homer capped a four-run eighth and lifted the Tigers to a 7-4 victory over the reeling Chicago White Sox.</p>
<p>The Tigers have won consecutive games after dropping eight in a row, but have won nine of their last 12 at home.</p>
<p>The White Sox have lost six of their last eight games.</p>
<p>In Kansas City, Juan Guzman tossed a complete-game six-hitter to win for the first time in over a month and lower his league-best ERA as the Toronto Blue Jays won their fourth straight, 6-2 over the Royals.</p>
<p>Guzman (10-8) won for the first time since July 16, a span of six starts. He allowed two runs -- one earned -- and lowered his ERA to 2.99.</p>
<p>At Minnesota, John Jaha's three-run homer, his 26th, capped a five-run eighth inning that rallied the Milwaukee Brewers to a 10-7 victory over the Twins.</p>
<p>Jaha added an RBI single in the ninth and had four RBI. Jose Valentin hit his 21st homer for Milwaukee.</p>
