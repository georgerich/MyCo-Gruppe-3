<p>The Indonesian rupiah was stable against the dollar in quiet trading on Wednesday, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said operators declined to buy dollars because of some underlying bearish sentiment but they were also reluctant to sell on worries of possible trouble at a court hearing of the opposition party scheduled for Thursday, August 22.</p>
<p>Megawati Sukarnoputri, ousted leader of the opposition Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI), has sued the government and the military for ousting her as party leader.</p>
<p>Spot rupiah was quoted at 2,342.0/42.5 at 0840 GMT against the opening of 2,341.75/42.25.  </p>
<p>Dealers said trading was pretty narrow which left little room to make a profit.</p>
<p>They said earlier some operators speculated on a strengthening of the rupiah as the current interest rate differentials would not be affected after the U.S. Federal Reserves held interest rate steady on Tuesday.</p>
<p>They said operators still could break the dollar's resistance at the 2,341.5 level because of the central bank's floor rate which limited further downside.</p>
<p>Tomorrow and today rupiah closed at 2,341.45/41.75 and 2,341.00/41.65, respectively.  </p>
<p>&quot;Operators tried to reduce trading and keep outstanding exposures at a minimum, so that they can reverse positions easily if anything unexpected does happen,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>He said operators generally did not expect anything major to happen on Thursday but they remained cautious.</p>
<p>One U.S. bank dealer said some activities were seen in the swap market, with offshore operators seen unloading six-month swap to a low of 107.0 points before it rebounded slightly to 108.0/110.0 points late in the afternoon.</p>
<p>One local bank dealer said some offshore players had some rupiah in excess which they parked in the forward market.  </p>
<p>He said speculation on a lower interest rate environment seemed to aide the downtrend partially.</p>
<p>Overnight swap was at 0.45/0.55 and tom/next at 0.50/0.55.</p>
<p>One-month swap was at 17.75/18.50, two-month at 35.0/36.5 and three-month at 55.0/56.5.</p>
<p>Dealers said liquidity supply was relatively ample late in the afternoon, with the call money easing to 9.5 percent from 12.0/13.0 percent in the morning.</p>
<p>The central bank raised its intervention rate by one point to 2,336/2,454 and the conversion rate also by one point to 2,336/2,382 on Wednesday.</p>
