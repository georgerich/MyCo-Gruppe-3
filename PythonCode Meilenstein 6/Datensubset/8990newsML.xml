<p>The Bundesbank lived up to its reputation of surprising financial markets with an aggressive monetary easing on Thursday, a move which has thrown the EMU ball back to its European partners, financial analysts said.</p>
<p>Those in the market who had expected a cut in the 3.30 percent repo rate had talked only of a 5-10 basis point move, so the 30 basis point slice came as a big surprise. This has got the market thinking that while the Bundesbank has in the past focused narrowly on domestic factors, it has decided this time to help its struggling European partners.</p>
<p>There was clearly a domestic element to the cut because the Bundesbank is worried about the impact the mark's strength is having on export competitiveness.</p>
<p>But the dollar showed reluctance to move higher and Germany can always resort to intervention, an extremely efficient weapon when wielded by the Bundesbank, analysts said.</p>
<p>In the past the Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan have thrown millions of dollars at the market in unsuccessful attempts to get the U.S. currency higher. When the Bundesbank joined in, it turned market sentiment around.</p>
<p>Given the scale of Thursday's cut, the Bundesbank seems to be saying to the rest of Europe...&quot;OK, we've done our bit, now you sort out your budgets if you want EMU to work&quot;.</p>
<p>Robert Prior, European economist at HSBC Markets, said: &quot;I think the Bundesbank is washing its hands and saying, well we can't be blamed for anything that happens with EMU, the ball is in your court.&quot;</p>
<p>To this end the Bundesbank will want to see austere packages in the swathe of budgets that are due across Europe over the rest of the year. Between now and the middle of October, France, Spain Italy, Belgium, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Portugal, Greece and the Netherlands will announce budgets or make statements on ongoing parliamentary budget negotiations. &quot;The European element is important here and they (Germany) want to give EMU as good a chance as possible,&quot; said Ian Amstad, international economist at Bankers Trust.</p>
<p>The Bundesbank's move enabled France to make a badly-needed cut in interest rates, with the intervention rate coming down to 3.35 percent from 3.55.</p>
<p>&quot;The French economy is in a lot of trouble at the moment... it needs lower rates if it's got any hopes of meeting the deficit criteria,&quot; said Thomas Rayner, international economist at Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull. But the real crunch will come with the budget, France will be the main focus of all the packages, on September 18 or 25. France is looking to lop 60 billion francs off public spending but the market may look for even more, analysts said.</p>
