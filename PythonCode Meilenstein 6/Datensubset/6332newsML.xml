<p>Alicia Machado, the Miss Universe reported to have become chubby, resurfaced on Wednesday but kept quiet about whether she had been ordered to lose weight fast or risk losing her crown.</p>
<p>Wearing a strapless light-green evening gown slit high on one thigh, Machado attended a full-dress rehearsal for the 1996 Miss Teen USA pageant, to take place Wednesday night in the New Mexico resort of Las Cruces.</p>
<p>While clearly heavier than the younger beauty queens onstage, the 19-year-old blonde Venezuelan, who won the Miss Universe title in May, looked well and seemed relaxed. She signed autographs for some young girls and chatted easily with reigning Miss USA Ali Landry and friends.</p>
<p>Most people in the audience said a few extra pounds had not hurt her. &quot;Well, she is bigger than the other girls out there, but she still looks great,&quot; local resident Ann Gardner said. &quot;She's a really fabulous girl.&quot;</p>
<p>The beauty pageant world was jolted on Monday when officials of the Miss Venezuela Organisation said Machado had been given an ultimatum by Miss Universe organisers to shed 27 pounds (12 kg) in two weeks or risk having her title taken away.</p>
<p>But Martin Brooks, president of Los Angeles-based Miss Universe Inc., said on Wednesday the claim was &quot;totally untrue&quot; and he had no idea where it came from.</p>
<p>Brooks spoke with Machado to assure her that organisers were not putting pressure on her and said she was well used to close public scrutiny in Venezuela, which takes its reputation as the world's beauty queen capital very seriously.</p>
<p>&quot;She's fine with it. She wished, as we all did, that it hadn't happened, but she's spiritually and mentally terrific. There's no problem whatsoever,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>At 5 feet 7 inches (1.73 meters) tall, Machado weighed 112 pounds (51 kg) in Las Vegas when she became the fourth Venezuelan to be named Miss Universe.</p>
<p>People close to her said she had gained some weight after the pageant by indulging a passion for pasta and cake, but it was still not clear on Wednesday how many pounds she had put on. Most people who saw her said she was still far from fat.</p>
<p>When news of Machado's alleged weight problem broke, reporters from around the United States and Latin America scrambled to get to Las Cruces and track her down.</p>
<p>Security was beefed up, with police officers deployed at the plush hotel where she and the teen pageant contestants were staying, and organisers blocked all access to Machado. They said on Wednesday they were trying to protect her from the publicity blaze but added that she had spoken to her family in Venezuela and so was aware of the fuss.</p>
<p>Although she had escaped from the public light for over 24 hours, Machado and her waistline were the talk of the town.</p>
<p>&quot;It's her body, her deal. She won the crown and they shouldn't take it away from her just for putting on a few pounds,&quot; said Autumn Smith, the reigning Miss Alabama USA and a contestant for Miss USA next year.</p>
<p>&quot;But, at the same time, if I'd won Miss Universe, I'd want to look the best I possibly could for that one year,&quot; the tall, 21-year-old brunette added.</p>
<p>Brooks said he had received calls from a couple of fans angered at what they believed were efforts to force Machado onto a radical diet. Organisers have always denied claims from some quarters that beauty pageants are glorified meat markets by stressing the importance of personality and &quot;inner beauty.&quot;</p>
<p>Teen pageant officials reassured the 51 contestants in Las Cruces no ultimatum had been given to Machado and personality and friendly disposition were as valued as ever in beauty pageants.</p>
<p>&quot;They told us it was all totally not true,&quot; Jodi Webb, 18 years old and the reigning Miss Teen Utah, said.</p>
<p>The 1996 Miss Teen USA Pageant was to take place Wednesday night at New Mexico State University. CBS television planned to broadcast the event nationwide.</p>
