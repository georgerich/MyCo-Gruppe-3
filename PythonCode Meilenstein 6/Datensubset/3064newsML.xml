<p>Med oil products were steady or a touch stronger on Tuesday. Naphtha was again steady relative to northern Europe, where prices have been pressured by good avails of Russian material.</p>
<p>One dealer said he saw September cif Med swaps at around $188.50, some $3 a tonne below cif NWE swaps. He also assessed full-range Alexandria-origin cargoes at a $3 or $3.50 premium to the quoted cif high. Greek material was also heard available.</p>
<p>Gasoline was stable and activity relatively thin. Dealers assessed prices as slightly firmer than in northwest Europe.  </p>
<p>Traders estimate that some 30,000 tonnes of low octane Russian gasoline was exported into the Black Sea in August, from previously negligible levels. The rise in exports stemmed from changing Russian internal demand patterns, traders said.</p>
<p>Gas oil held firm with good demand from inside and outside the region continuing to underpin prices.</p>
<p>Traders said Brazil's Petrobras could lift up to 300,000 tonnes of 0.3-0.5 percent sulphur material this month from Italy and Algeria, while Turkish demand was seen absorbing Russian cargoes out of the Black Sea.  </p>
<p>Italian heating oil was pegged at quotes fob high +$5 a tonne fob Italy, while 0.05 percent diesel was assessed at a premium of $17 over fob quotes. High sulphur cracked fuel oil was a touch firmer at around $85-86 fob Med. Traders said there was some interest in a 50,000 tonne bunker spec cargo understood already on the market. The Tunisian tender for 100,000 tonnes of high sulphur cracked with a September to January delivery was to be awarded today.</p>
<p>Low sulphur cracked material was slow, the main Med buyer remained quiet.</p>
