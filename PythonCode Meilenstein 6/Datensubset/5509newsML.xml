<headline>Canadian bonds end weaker, outperform U.S. market.</headline>

<p>Canadian bonds closed weaker on Wednesday, but outperformed a softer U.S. market amid a successful five-year bond auction and speculation the Bank of Canada will cut rates, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's pure and simple. The U.S. market is lower and we're lower,&quot; said one Toronto-based bond dealer. &quot;There is some pricing in of a possible Bank of Canada ease.&quot;</p>
<p>Canada's 8.0 percent bond due 2023 fell C$0.32 to C$102.78 to yield 7.750 percent. The U.S. 30-year benchmark fell 15/32 to yield 6.84 percent. The spread between the bonds narrowed to 91 basis points from 93 basis points at Tuesday's close.  </p>
<p>Speculation the central bank will ease short-term interest rates has been in Canadian debt markets since the Bank's successful ease of August 9.</p>
<p>Some dealers have said the Bank of Canada might ease as early as tomorrow if Germany lowers interest rates and Canadian retail sales were weaker-than-expected.</p>
<p>&quot;I think for sure they will be cutting rates. They're just waiting for the dollar to firm up. They want to take advantage of every opportunity. The Canadian economy is not all that strong,&quot; said Philip Strathy, vice-president of Strathy Investments.  </p>
<p>In new issue news, the Government of Canada's auction of C$2.7 billion of 7.0 percent bonds due September 1, 2001 had an average yield of 6.493 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The five-year auction went well,&quot; said Strathy.</p>
<p>In other prices, the 7.0 percent of 2006 fell C$0.17 to C$98.17 to yield 7.254 percent. The U.S. 10-year benchmark fell 9/32 to yield 6.61 percent.</p>
<p>The spread between the two bonds narrowed to 64 basis points from 65 basis points at Tuesday's close.</p>
<p>The three-month cash bill traded at 4.04 percent against the U.S. three-month bill at 5.14 percent.</p>
