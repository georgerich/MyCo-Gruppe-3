<p>China plans to set up a public library in every county by 2010 as part of efforts to fight illiteracy, the China Daily said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Culture also plans to build children's libraries in every district of major and medium-sized cities, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>By 1995, China had 2,615 public libraries, holding more than 300 million books and documents, it said.</p>
<p>However, about 200 counties and most towns in China did not have a library and there were only 70 children's libraries nationally, concentrated in major cities, it said.</p>
<p>China's illiteracy rate at the end of 1995 was 12.01 percent. This means about 145 million people out of a population of more than 1.2 billion can neither read nor write.</p>
