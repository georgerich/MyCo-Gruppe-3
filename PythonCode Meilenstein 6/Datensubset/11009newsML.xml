<p>Croatia and Serbian-led Yugoslavia prepared to sign a landmark accord on mutual recognition on Friday, ending five years of wartime hostility.</p>
<p>Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic met his Yugoslav counterpart Milan Milutinovic to work out final details of the agreement before a planned signing ceremony in Belgrade.</p>
<p>Yugoslav officials postponed the ceremony, originally scheduled for midday (1000 GMT), for later in the afternoon because the two sides needed time to resolve one last issue.</p>
<p>Granic, who led the delegation from Zagreb, drove through Belgrade in a limousine carrying a Croatian flag -- the first time the Croatian banner has been unfurled on Yugoslav territory since the federation collapsed in 1991.</p>
<p>Earlier, the Yugoslav government endorsed the text of the agreement on normalising relations between the two countries, the state news agency Tanjug reported.</p>
<p>&quot;The government assessed the agreement as a crucial step to resolving the Yugoslav crisis, ensuring restoration of peace in former Yugoslavia,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The agreement sets long-term foundations for the development of relations and cooperation between Yugoslavia and Croatia and &quot;for resolving certain issues caused by the Yugoslav crisis&quot;.</p>
<p>Last-minute talks this week on the legal fine print finally cleared the way for a treaty based on mutual recognition within internationally recognised borders and establishment of diplomatic relations, diplomats said.</p>
<p>The pact ends five years of hostility after Croatia's declaration of independence from federal Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>Western powers view mutual recognition between the two most powerful states emerging from old Yugoslavia as a crucial step towards a lasting peace in the Balkans.</p>
<p>Granic on Thursday invited all members of diplomatic corps in Zagreb to inform them of Friday's event.</p>
<p>Presidents Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia and Franjo Tudjman of Croatia agreed in Athens earlier this month to have their foreign ministers sign a recognition accord on August 23.</p>
<p>Experts negotiating the treaty text have have been trying to resolve issues including a stubborn territorial dispute over the Prevlaka peninsula on the Adriatic coast, the legal succession to old Yugoslavia, war damages and protection for Serb refugees trying to return to Croatia.</p>
<p>The main state-run Croatian newspaper Vjesnik said on Thursday three days of talks this week apparently yielded &quot;understanding&quot; on sticking points.</p>
<p>&quot;The agreement opens possibilities for achieving mutually acceptable solutions regarding territorial issues in further talks,&quot; the Yugoslav government said.</p>
<p>Diplomatic sources here said the two sides agreed that Prevlaka was no longer a &quot;territorial but a security issue&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;This probably means that Prevlaka will remain Croatian but will be demilitarized,&quot; a western diplomat said.</p>
<p>War broke out in 1991 after Croatia declared independence to escape creeping domination by Milosevic-led nationalist Serbs in the Balkan federation. Fighting spread to Bosnia when its Moslem-led government broke away in 1992.</p>
<p>Minority Serbs armed by Milosevic seized almost a third of Croatia in the 1991 war but lost almost all of it to a Croatian army counter-offensive over U.N. truce lines a year ago.</p>
<p>Eastern Slavonia, the last Serb-held enclave in Croatia, is due to revert to Croatian government rule next year after a transitional period under U.N. administration.</p>
