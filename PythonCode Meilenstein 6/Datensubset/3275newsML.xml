<title>RUSSIA: Rouble firms on T-bill, central bank dollar sales.</title>
<headline>Rouble firms on T-bill, central bank dollar sales.</headline>
<dateline>MOSCOW 1996-08-20</dateline>

<p>The rouble firmed on Tuesday ahead of Wednesday's Treasury bill auctions and dealers said a squeeze for roubles was also due to large dollar sales by the central bank last Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;The dollar dipped ahead of T-bill auctions and high overnight rates are a confirmation of that,&quot; Konversbank dealer Igor Mamkov said. Rouble rates were unlikely to firm further today in otherwise calm trading, he said.</p>
<p>On Wednesday the central bank is auctioning 7.5 trillion roubles of six-month paper and four trillion roubles of three-month bills.</p>
<p>Overnight rouble credits yielded 50-70 percent compared with Monday's late 20-25 percent.</p>
<p>Roubles for today settlement were quoted at 5,297-5,300 per dollar, the same as in early trading, after 5,302-04 late on Monday. Tomorrow roubles edged up to 5,300-03 per dollar from yesterday's late 5,304-06.</p>
<p>The central bank said it had set 5,290/5,320 as its bid and offer rates against the dollar on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Banks want to catch the last wagon of the last train, as they expect a fall in T-bill yields. Even banks who usually offer funds are bidding today,&quot; Inkombank chief dealer Vladimir Kudryavtsev said.</p>
<p>He added the rouble shortage also reflected heavy dolalr buying by commercial banks from the central bank on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Banks bought dollars from the central bank for tomorrow settlement and the roubles left the market yesterday, so the rouble deficit can be felt now, but it is not total,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Some dealers said the central bank had sold up to $200 million on Friday.</p>
<p>No comment from the central bank was immediately available.</p>
