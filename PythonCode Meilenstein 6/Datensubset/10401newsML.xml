<p>Blue-chip stocks fell Friday, as surprisingly strong economic data stoked inflation fears and triggered a sell-off in the bond market.</p>
<p>The benchmark 30-year Tresaury bond skidded one point, raising its yield to 6.92 percent -- the highest in over three weeks -- from 6.83 percent at Thursday's close, after a surprisingly strong July durable goods order report.</p>
<p>&quot;Durable goods put a kibosh on the bond market,&quot; said Ed Nicoski, a Piper Jaffray technical analyst. &quot;That put a damper on stocks and will hurt interest-rate sensitive financial stocks which had been the best performer in recent months.&quot;</p>
<p>At 1 p.m. EDT, the Dow Jones industrial average lost 9.25 to 5,724.22. In the broader market, losing issues outpaced gainers 4-3 on sluggish volume of 190 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq Composite index gave up earlier gains and fell 0.22 to 1,143.74.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, market analysts remained impressed by the market's performance given the slump in bonds.</p>
<p>The Dow on Thursday surged 44 points, leaving the blue chip index less than 50 points from its record closing high 5,778.00 set May 22.</p>
<p>&quot;My gut feeling is this market does not fall out of bed just yet,&quot; said Ralph Bloch, chief technical analyst at Raymond James.</p>
<p>&quot;If you step back and look at the Dow and Nasdaq Composite over the past 2-1/2 weeks, they're consolidating their run,&quot; he said. &quot;People were bearish and buying puts after the durable goods order number so that's a technical plus.&quot;</p>
<p>July durable goods orders rose 1.6 percent, against expectations for a 0.3 percent advance. June durables were revised up to a 0.2 percent drop from the previously reported 0.6 percent fall.</p>
<p>Bond traders said the data and expectations that job growth jumped in August may reignite talk of an increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve, which left interest rates unchanged at its meeting on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Among financial stocks, Dow component J.P. Morgan lost 1-5/8 to 90-7/8, Chase Manhattan was off 1-1/2 to 78 and Merrill Lynch slipped 3/8 to 63-1/4.</p>
<p>Another focus was tobacco stocks.</p>
<p>Investors were awaiting details of President Clinton's approval of a plan by the Food and Drug Administration to regulate tobacco use by children. Clinton planned to announce plans at a White House ceremony Friday afternoon.</p>
<p>Wall Street was also awaiting a verdict from a key tobacco litigation case in Indiana. The jury started deliberating Thursday.</p>
<p>Philip Morris was unchanged at 86-7/8. Smokeless tobacco maker UST Inc. slipped 1/4 to 30-1/2 and RJR Nabisco, parent of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, rose 1/2 to 25-3/4.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no sign of a bottom yet&quot; in Morris and other tobacco shares amid the legal and regulatory uncertainty, Bloch said.</p>
<p>As for the broader market, Brett Discher, a vice president of equity trading at Dain Bosworth, said, &quot;It's a typical Friday, kind of quiet.&quot;</p>
<p>He and other analysts saw a resumption of more normal trading activity after the U.S. Labour Day holiday Sept. 2 as traders return from vacations.</p>
<p>Among individual stocks, Circus Circus rose 2-1/4 to 33-5/8. Merrill Lynch upgraded the stock to long-term buy from accumulate.</p>
<p>AnnTaylor lost 1-5/8 to 14. Sally Frame Kasaks resigned as chairman, chief executive officer and a director. J.P. Morgan, which had previously recommended buying the stock, downgraded it to market performer.</p>
<p>Paper and forest products stocks firmed after Goldman Sachs started coverage of the sector with overweight. Georgia-Pacific, up 1-5/8 to 77-3/4, and Willamette, up 1-1/8 to 64-3/4, were added to Goldman's recommended list. Boise Cascade, rated a Goldman buy, rose 5/8 to 35.</p>
