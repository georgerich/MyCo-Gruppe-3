<headline>New Zealand dollar ends higher, seen range-trading.</headline>
<dateline>WELLINGTON 1996-08-21</dateline>

<p>The New Zealand dollar hitched a ride with the Australian currency to close higher on Wednesday, and dealers said it looked content to range trade for the time being.</p>
<p>S&amp;P said they had put Australia on creditwatch positive after Tuesday's budget.</p>
<p>&quot;Pretty much tracking closely the Aussie,&quot; one dealer said of the Kiwi. &quot;Aussie made a reasonable recovery, testing the 70 cent (U.S.) area, and with that Kiwi has been able to chug on up,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>The Kiwi closed at US$0.6902/09, up from its 0.6894/01 open. However, at 65.44 the Kiwi was a touch weaker on its Trade-Weighted Index, having opened at 65.48.</p>
<p>&quot;The Kiwi has been lacking a bit of its own momentum just lately. There's obviously been a lot of interest rate buying over the last week, and that's kept us in a healthy tone,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;We're just sort of ranging before we find out which way Aussie's going.&quot; The Australian currency closed at US$0.7897/02.</p>
<p>Dealers expected the Kiwi to trade a 0.6890-6920 range overnight.</p>
