<p>Demand for Canadian durum wheat and semolina should remain steady despite better production prospects in Europe, a rival exporting region, European and Latin American processors said.</p>
<p>&quot;In the past two years, the protein content in European durum was lower, at about 12 percent on dry matter, from 14 percent. Canadian durum's not a problem, it has good colour and you know what you're buying,&quot; said Greet Verbrugghe, head of laboratory for Belgium-based  Soubry, a pasta and couscous manufacturer.  </p>
<p>Processors and purchasers from Belgium, Italy, Cyprus, Mexico and Peru were in Winnipeg for a durum seminar held by the Canadian International Grains Institute.</p>
<p>European and Latin American processors said high protein content would assure Canadian market share while Canadian officials expect protein levels this year to exceed last year's.</p>
<p>&quot;It's been raining a lot in France and also in Spain, (which may reduce protein content) so the quality is more consistent in Canada. We don't use it pure. We always blend it with European wheat,&quot; Verbrugghe said.  </p>
<p>European output may rise a third from last year's drought-cut production.</p>
<p>Production in western Canada, however, was widely expected to have suffered from drought-like conditions in July.</p>
<p>But while the dry, hot weather in July was expected to harm production, it may raise protein content.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm hoping the protein level will rebound from last year, usually that requires heat,&quot; Canadian Grain Commission chief Milt Wakefield said.  </p>
<p>Some wheat and durum importers complained last year when protein content on durum from Saskatoon to the Alberta border fell to 13.0 percent from the usual average of 13.5 to 13.7.</p>
<p>Changes in European tariffs may also favor Canadian durum.</p>
<p>The changes stem from World Trade Organization rules triggered by the enlargement of the European Union to include Austria, Finland and Sweden.</p>
<p>The quotas were to come in place January 1, 1996 to compensate for the enlargement of the EU. But implementation has been delayed by a disagreement on oat shipments.</p>
<p>Latin Americans also want Canada's high-protein semolina.</p>
<p>&quot;In Peru, we need high protein semolina. In coming years, all our pasta will be made with 100 percent semolina,&quot; said Jesus Arenas Vera, plant manager for Peru's Consorcio de Alimentos Fabril Pacifico.</p>
<p>Pasta consumption in Peru averaged 12 kg (26.5 lbs) per person a year in the 1980s to nine kg (20 lbs) per person a year now, Arenas said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think in the next decade it will rise again because pasta is quite cheap,&quot; Arenas said.</p>
