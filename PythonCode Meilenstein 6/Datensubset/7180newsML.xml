<p>By Colin Brinsden</p>
<p>Australian bonds screamed ahead in afternoon trading after Standard &amp; Poor's revised Australia's credit risk outlook to positive, taking long-dated yields to their lowest level in 2-1/2 years.</p>
<p>&quot;It's good news...the risks are going down,&quot; said Stephen Koukoulas senior economist at Citibank Australia. &quot;The market is all bulled up and still wanting wanting to get long even at these sort of levels.&quot;</p>
<p>The yield on the 10-year bond slid to around 7.80 percent and the spread to the U.S. screeched into 125 basis points.  </p>
<p>S&amp;P said it had revised the outlook to positive from stable reflected the substantial fiscal tightening implied by the Commonwealth Government's budget statement on Tuesday and that Australia's net public external debt burden could decline markedly if this fiscal stance is maintained medium term.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P news proved the turning point for the market that had otherwise look content to take profits after Treasurer Peter Costello's first budget, while tough, pulled few surprises.</p>
<p>&quot;The actual outcome was somewhat disappointing because the underlying deficit has not been wound back as quickly as expected,&quot; economists at Commonwealth Bank said in a report.  </p>
<p>&quot;Nevertheless, over the medium term, the measures introduced in this budget should be positive for the Australian economy and financial markets,&quot; the report added.</p>
<p>Costello announced an underlying budget deficit of A$5.65 billion and a headline surplus of A$474 million for 1996/97 after savings of A$3.9 billion.</p>
<p>The market is already building in the possibility of a post-budget cut in official interest rates to match last month's 50 basis point reduction to 7.0 percent, while Advance Bank, BankSA and non-bank home lender Aussie Homes have already jumped the gun by shaving their fixed mortgage rates today.  </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Westpac's leading index of economic activity fell 0.8 percent and its leading inflation index dropped 0.5 percentage points in June.</p>
<p>&quot;The combination of a soft forward outlook for activity and continuing moderation in inflationary pressures provide the pre-conditions for the Reserve Bank to be contemplating a further interest rate cut in the near term,&quot; said Westpac's general manager, economics, Bill Evans said.</p>
<p>The active December bill futures contract ended at 93.41, indicating a cash rate of 6.59 percent at maturity.  </p>

<p>The Australian/U.S. 10-year spread breached a pre-budget 130 basis points resistance low on the S&amp;P announcement to stand at its lowest level in over two years. This spread margin stood at some 250 b.p. just four months ago and some analysts now see a further narrowing to 100 basis points.  </p>
