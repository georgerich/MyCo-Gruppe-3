<headline>FOOD AND HOUSING COSTS DRIVE S.AFRICAN JULY CPI.</headline>
<dateline>JOHANNESBURG 1996-08-21</dateline>
<text>
<p>Higher food and housing costs were the principal drivers of South African consumer price inflation in July, the Central Statistical Service said.</p>
<p>July CPI increased 0.8 percent month-on-month and 7.1 percent year-on-year -- the highest level of inflation since August 1995 when the annual rate was 7.5 percent.</p>
<p>The data was in with a Reuter consensus poll of economists.</p>
<p>The CSS said price indices for food contributed 0.3 percentage point to last month's 0.8 point monthly increase while housing accounted for 0.2 point, mainly due to large increases in assessment rates which were slightly countered by a one point drop in mortgage bond rates.</p>
<p>Fuel and power added 0.1 point to the monthly increase, household operation 0.1 point and all other items 0.1 point.</p>
<p>The annual rate of increase in food prices is now the highest since July 1995 with the food price index rising by 4.8 percent year-on-year last month, 2.3 percentage points higher than in June.</p>
<p>From June to July, food prices increased 1.5 percent, after falling 0.3 percent from May to June. The jump reflected the higher prices for grain products (+1.3 percent), meat (+1.4 percent), fish (+0.7 percent), dairy (+1.4 percent) and oils and fats (+1.2 percent) and fruit (+2.1 percent).</p>
<p>The monthly rate of increase in July CPI excluding food was 0.6 percent.</p>
<p>South African consumer price data relates to the first seven days of the month.</p>
