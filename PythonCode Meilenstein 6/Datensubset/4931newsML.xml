<title>FRANCE: Bombs hit Corsican building, target politician.</title>
<headline>Bombs hit Corsican building, target politician.</headline>
<dateline>AJACCIO, Corsica 1996-08-20</dateline>
<text>
<p>Police said on Tuesday they had defused a bomb at the home of a top Corsican politician, and a bomb blast damaged the office of a government official on the French Mediterranean island.</p>
<p>The device was planted on the doorstep of the Ajaccio flat of former industry minister Jose Rossi, the president of the elected council of south Corsica.</p>
<p>Police defused it late on Monday it after an anonymous telephone warning. They said Rossi had been scheduled to spend the night at the flat, which is occupied by his daughter and son-in-law.</p>
<p>The attack, the first direct one against Rossi, came a few days after a bomb wrecked a villa belonging to his elected council. The attacks mark an escalation of violence on the island, torn by separatist strife.</p>
<p>A powerful bomb damaged the office of the central government representative in Sartene early on Tuesday, wrecking his car.</p>
<p>Police said the attackers scaled a high wall protecting the office and lowered the bomb into the grounds with a rope.</p>
<p>It was the fifth bombing of a public building on the island in just over a week.</p>
<p>No one has claimed responsibility for the attacks, but Corsican separatists seeking greater autonomy from mainland France regularly target government buildings in a guerrilla campaign that has been going on for two decades.</p>
<p>The French justice ministry said last week the flare-up of violence would not &quot;diminish its determination to seek out and and punish the perpetrators of terrorist acts&quot;.</p>
