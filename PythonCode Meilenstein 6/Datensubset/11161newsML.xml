<p>President Abdala Bucaram, saying he would not allow any damage to Ecuador's sovereignty, Thursday warned the U.S. oil firm Maxus that it will have to accept a new contract for its operations in the country.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not going to allow any damage to the country's sovereignty, nor shall we allow our own wealth and interests to suffer,&quot; he told reporters.</p>
<p>Bucaram, a populist politician who took office 12 days ago, Tuesday cancelled the deal with Maxus saying the U.S. firm refused to participate in a joint venture with state oil company Petroecuador.</p>
<p>&quot;The fact is that if we reach an accord it will have to allow us control over our petrol. It is inadmissible for them to tell us that during 10 years the cost of running the operation was bigger than the price of oil,&quot; Bucaram said.</p>
<p>&quot;If Maxus is interested in joining the interests of the people of Ecuador, then that's fine,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Dallas-based Maxus, which has been bought by Argentina's YPF SA, has been operating oil wells in a border region with Colombia over the past nine years and produces some 34,000 barrels per day.</p>
<p>Energy and Mines minister Alfredo Adum brushed off concerns that Maxus' suspension and the decision to revise contracts with foreign firms could affect the flow of international capital into the country.</p>
