<headline>German TV station fined for too much advertising.</headline>

<p>A German court on Thursday fined the RTL television network 20 million marks ($13.5 million) for exceeding a legal restriction on the amount of advertising allowed on television.</p>
<p>German media authorities had taken RTL to court saying the TV network in 1993 and 1994 had shown too many commercials during around 34 movies.</p>
<p>RTL said the movies in question were really a series of novels filmed for TV, which would have allowed the network to interupt programming more frequently with advertising.</p>
<p>German media law restricts how often television movies can be interupted by advertising. Television series can show more advertising than feature films.</p>
<p>Despite RTL's objections, the court upheld the media watchdog's complaint, saying the movies were not related and therefore could not be considered a series.</p>
<p>RTL said it would appeal the decision. ($ = 1.484 German Marks)</p>
