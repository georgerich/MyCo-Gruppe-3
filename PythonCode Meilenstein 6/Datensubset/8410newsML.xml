<p>Former Iranian president Abolhassan Banisadr started to testify on Thursday in a heavily guarded German courtroom where he is expected to say Tehran backed the 1992 machinegun killing of Kurd opposition leaders.</p>
<p>Banisadr said in June that Iran's president and religious leader knew of and blessed the gangland-style shooting of three Iranian Kurdish leaders and their translator in a Berlin restaurant.</p>
<p>Tehran has denied his allegations.</p>
<p>Banisadr, 63, also told German authorities he had heard Tehran was sending two squads of hired assassins to intimidate him while he gives evidence in Berlin on Thursday and Friday.</p>
<p>The court in the city's Moabit district was surrounded by a top-security cordon. Police marksmen were posted on surrounding roofs and traffic was diverted away from the main road where the court is located.</p>
<p>Banisadr will be the star prosecution witness against an Iranian, Kazem Darabi, and four Lebanese who have been on trial for nearly three years on charges of murdering the dissidents.</p>
<p>Two masked men armed with machineguns burst into the Mykonos restaurant in Berlin on September 17, 1992, and fired at dozens of Iranian dissidents seated at a table.</p>
<p>Three leaders of the Iranian Democratic Party of Kurdistan (DPK-I) and their translator were killed in the hail of bullets.</p>
<p>In an interview with German prosecutors in June Banisadr said that the attack would have been impossible without the backing and blessing of Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's religious leader.</p>
<p>The case has strained relations between Bonn and Tehran, particularly after prosecutors issued an arrest warrant in March for Iranian Intelligence Minister Ali Fallahiyan, accusing him of masterminding the attack.</p>
<p>Iran has denied Fallahiyan was involved in the killing.</p>
<p>Tehran has also rejected Banisadr's allegations, saying that he is a fierce opponent of its Islamic fundamentalist government and that 14 years have passed since his administration was toppled and his ties with Iran were severed.</p>
