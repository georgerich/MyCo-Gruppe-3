<p>Caracas stocks continued rising albeit in thin trade on the back of Friday's surge as foreign bidders foucsed on key blue chip stocks such as foods producer Mavesa, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Investors are back because stocks are under-priced,&quot; said one broker.</p>
<p>Mavesa gained 6.00 bolivars to close at 112.00 as some 3.5 million shares were cross traded at a price of around 110 bolivars, traders said.</p>
<p>The market's 19-share index gained 1.92 percent to close at 4,582.03.  </p>
<p>Nearly 14 million shares traded worth 1.8 billion bolivars ($3.8 million). Among traded issues, 31 rose, five closed flat and five fell.</p>
<p>Despite the day's performance, &quot;this is still a very undynamic market,&quot; said Incambios broker Adelso Gonzalez. &quot;We're still waiting for foreign institutional money to come in... that's when things will really take off.&quot;  </p>
<p>Among the session's other leading trades, Mantex edged ahead 0.10 bolivar to close at 43 bolivars as nearly one million shares were cross-traded, while Sudamtex B stock gained 0.45 bolivars to close at 58.45 as 500,000 shares were cross-traded.</p>
