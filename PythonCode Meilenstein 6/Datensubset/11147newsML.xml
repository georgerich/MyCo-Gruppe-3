<title>COLOMBIA: British Petroluem denies Colombian army in its pay.</title>
<headline>British Petroluem denies Colombian army in its pay.</headline>
<dateline>BOGOTA, Colombia 1996-08-22</dateline>

<p>The British Petroleum Co denied Thursday a report published in the New York Times suggesting that the Colombian army was on its payroll or somehow under its control.</p>
<p>The company's BP Exploration Company (Colombia) Ltd issued the unusual denial in reponse to a New York Times story referring to a recent upsurge in guerrilla activity in Colombia and steps it said BP had taken to confront them.</p>
<p>&quot;The implication in the New York Times article that the Colombian army is therefore somehow in the pay of BP is wrong,&quot; the company statement said. &quot;Nor is the Colombian army in any sense under BP's control or direction,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>BP conceded that it and its partners share the cost of military protection of the Cusiana and Cupiagua oil development project in Colombia's eastern plains.</p>
<p>But it said in a statement that &quot;the payments made by BP and its partners to the Ministry of Defense are confined to the provision of non-lethal aid -- i.e. food, clothes. accomodation, transport, communication and health programs.&quot;</p>
<p>It also stressed that the payments are made by all four partners in the Cusiana development in Colombia's eastern plains, with the largest share coming from the state oil company Ecopetrol.</p>
<p>It also denied that the security arrangement was &quot;a recent response to the upsurge in guerrilla activity described by the New York Times.</p>
<p>&quot;The oil industry has long been exposed to particular risk in Colombia and arrangements such as these have been in place from the early stages of oil development,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The New York Times report said BP's three-year protection deal with the Defense Ministry had just been signed and was valued at $54 million to $60 million -- a cost to be borne solely by the British oil firm.</p>
<p>A BP spokesman said the three-year agreement was signed in 1995, however, and valued at $11.6 million. Ecopetrol bears 50 percent of the cost, he said, with 19 percent going to BP, another 19 percent going to Total of France and 12 percent to Dalls-based Triton Energy.</p>
<p>&quot;Other oil companies, and many businesses outside the oil sector, have similar arrangements,&quot; the company statement said.</p>
