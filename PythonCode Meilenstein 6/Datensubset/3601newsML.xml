<p>Israel sought to reassure its citizens on Tuesday following reports that Syria had recently tested a long-range Scud missile capable of hitting targets across the Jewish state.</p>
<p>Israel test fired its Arrow 2 anti-missile missile on Tuesday as its media reported that Syria was holding military exercises.</p>
<p>Israel's Channel Two television reported on Monday that Syria had tested several weeks ago a Scud C missile, capable of hitting Israeli cities.</p>
<p>The reports signalled rising tensions fuelled by a deadlock in Middle East peace talks since Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu won Israeli elections in May.</p>
<p>&quot;Syria had been arming itself with Scud missiles for quite some time. What it's doing now is moving from purchase to manufacture. They're trying to manufacture these Scuds,&quot; Netanyahu told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;But they're the same Scuds with the same capabilities. So there is no new strategic factor in the equation between Syria and Israel,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Israeli Defence Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, commenting on reports of Syrian military exercises, told Israel Radio: &quot;I propose we do not connect that to any sort of tension. It's possible that they're worried on the other side...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I would suggest that you not create tensions and false pressures,&quot; Mordechai said.</p>
<p>Tension between Syria and Israel escalated after Netanyahu said Israel would retain the Golan Heights, captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war. Peace talks between Israel and Syria have made little headway for over four years.</p>
<p>Zeev Maoz, head of the Jaffee Centre for Strategic Studies, Israel's best known think-tank, said on Sunday the probability of war with Syria had increased with Netanyahu's election. Maoz said Netanyahu's position could push Damascus to try to break a diplomatic stalemate by starting a war.</p>
<p>Lebanon and Syria have both publicly rejected Netanyahu's &quot;Lebanon First&quot; proposal -- by which Israel would withdraw from south Lebanon for the right security guarantees -- as a ploy to avoid handing the strategic Golan Heights back to Damascus.</p>
<p>Syria accused Israel on Tuesday of beating war drums in the Middle East and said that the Jewish state would lose in any conflict with the Arab world.</p>
<p>On Monday Netanyahu warned, during his first visit to Israeli-occupied south Lebanon since his election, that pro-Iranian Hizbollah guerrilla raids on Israeli forces would only worsen the situation.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not good for Syria, Lebanon or Hizbollah or Israel. Therefore our choice is to try to reach a calming of the situation and guaranteeing security for all,&quot; Netanyahu said.</p>
<p>Israel says Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon where it has 35,000 troops, could curb Hizbollah guerrillas fighting to oust Israel from south Lebanon.</p>
<p>A senior source in Netanyahu's government said Israel was not trying to heat up the situation with Syria.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no intention to heat up the border with Syria,&quot; a government source who spoke on condition he not be named told Reuters.</p>
<p>Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy said that missile tests were not the way to signal a desire for peace.</p>
<p>&quot;If Syria wants peace, the tone and style is not with missiles or weapons like that,&quot; Levy told reporters.</p>
