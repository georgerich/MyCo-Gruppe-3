<headline>German shares end bourse higher after rate cut.</headline>

<p>German shares ended bourse trade over half a percentage point higher on Thursday after the Bundesbank decided to cut its main money market interest rate, the repo, by a larger-than-expected 30 basis points.</p>
<p>The 30-share blue chip DAX index closed 13.52 points, or 0.53 percent, higher at 2,557.26 points.</p>
<p>The move to cut the repo rate to an historically-low three percent from 3.30 percent took the market by surprise, particularly as it came in the wake of Wednesday's release of an unexpectedly strong Ifo business climate index for July.</p>
<p>Dealers had been expecting either no change or a five or ten point trimming of the repo.</p>
<p>The Bundesbank left its official discount and Lombard rates -- the floor and ceiling for money market rates -- unchanged at 2.50 and 4.50 percent, respectively, in line with economists' expectations.</p>
<p>Dealers in Frankfurt said the possibility for greater gains coming in the wake of the rate cut was limited, as many market players felt the end of the current interest rate cycle had now been reached.</p>
<p>Stocks in the spotlight included chemical giant BASF AG, which ended floor trade 89 pfennigs higher at 43.13 after reporting a rise in first-half pre-tax profit to 2.323 billion marks from 2.025 billion -- slightly above expectations, dealers said.</p>
<p>Chemicals group Merck KGaA initially took a dip of three percent after analysts at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell cut their EPS forecast on the share for the next three years.</p>
<p>The Merck share price came off earlier lows to end the day down 1.85 marks at 55.65 marks.</p>
<p>Construction group Hochtief AG ended floor trade 40 pfennigs higher at 66.90 marks after its first half figures showed an increase in orders for the group.</p>
