<p>Major powers may ask Australia to bypass India's veto on a draft nuclear test ban treaty by putting the pact before the U.N. General Assembly, diplomats said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Australia has the credibility, the tradition in disarmament and the ability to talk to both sides,&quot; said one diplomat.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, India prevented the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) from being adopted at talks in Geneva.</p>
<p>Diplomats said the five declared nuclear powers -- the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France -- considered Australia best placed to present the draft treaty to the assembly in the form of a resolution calling for a swift signing ceremony.</p>
<p>Asked about the possibility, Australian disarmament ambassador Richard Starr said nothing would be decided before a Conference on Disarmament meeting on Thursday due to wrap up the Geneva talks.</p>
<p>&quot;Three years of hard and patient work have gone into that text and many years of expectation before that. It cannot just be left to die,&quot; Starr told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;But we have certainly taken no decisions.&quot;</p>
<p>The General Assembly asked the conference last year to conclude a pact so that it could be signed in late September when heads of state and government meet in New York at the outset of the assembly's next session.</p>
<p>That resolution, and previous disarmament resolutions, were co-sponsored by Australia, New Zealand and Mexico.</p>
<p>Unlike the General Assembly, the Geneva conference takes its decsions by consensus. India, one of three nuclear &quot;threshold states&quot; along with Pakistan and Israel, confirmed on Tuesday that it was vetoing a draft that most conference participants accept.</p>
<p>New Delhi says it has to reject the text because it does not contain a commitment by the five nuclear powers to dispose of their nuclear arsenals and it preserves the nuclear divide.</p>
<p>After Tuesday's meeting, U.S. disarmament ambassador Stephen Ledogar accused the Indian government of wanting to maintain its nuclear weapon option and said Washington would work to have the treaty adopted despite India's veto.</p>
<p>Ledogar outlined two options, which he termed the &quot;single hijack scenario&quot; and the &quot;double hijack scenario&quot;.</p>
<p>The first involves simply presenting the spurned treaty to the current session of the General Assembly as a resolution that would need only a majority vote to pass, although it could be opened up to a flood of amendments that could kill it.</p>
<p>The &quot;double hijack scenario&quot; would entail bypassing the United Nations altogether and convening an international conference to have the treaty signed.</p>
<p>Diplomats said on Thursday that the second option had not garnered any support among U.S. allies and the debate was focusing on who would present the resolution in New York.</p>
<p>The five nuclear powers, who all now back the draft treaty, consider it would be counter-productive to co-sponsor the resolution themselves. Another alternative would be to have a geographically balanced group of co-sponsors.</p>
<p>But diplomats said there was growing agreement that having a single sponsor -- Australia has strong anti-nuclear credentials -- would be the most risk-free course. Mexico, which has reservations about the treaty, and New Zealand are both said to be wary about joining Australia.</p>
<p>Success for the draft in New York would depend on the support of the large number of non-aligned countries. Diplomats say influential non-aligned states such as Indonesia and Egypt would have to be fully behind the proposed pact to swing wavering voters.</p>
<p>&quot;I think Australia has reason to be concerned at the situation in the CD (Conference on Disarmament),&quot; Starr said. &quot;We've worked as hard as anyone for this text.&quot;</p>
