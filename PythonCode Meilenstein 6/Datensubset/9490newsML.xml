<p>High-technology military incinerators began burning deadly nerve gas rockets at Tooele, Utah, on Thursday under a program to eliminate the entire U.S. chemical weapons arsenal by 2004.</p>
<p>The first M-55 GB nerve gas rocket was incinerated at about 10 a.m. EDT (1400 GMT), a defense official said.</p>
<p>He said the incinerators at the Tooele Chemical Agent Disposal Facility, about 50 miles (80 km) southwest of Salt Lake City, might burn as many as 60 of the rockets during the day.</p>
<p>Tooele is the first of eight sites in the United States involved in destroying the entire U.S. arsenal of about 3.6 million chemical weapons by 2004. Army spokeswoman Kathy Gibbs said the cost of the entire project would be about $12 billion.</p>
<p>Incinerators on the Johnston Atoll in the Pacific have been destroying the weapons at a low rate since 1993, but Tooele and other sites on the mainland will destroy them in large volumes, defense officials said.</p>
<p>Robots in the facilities drill holes in each weapon to drain out the nerve, blister or other chemical agents and then take the metal shells and chemical agents to separate incinerators, the officials said.</p>
<p>They said both the metal shells and chemical agents were burned at such high temperatures that virtually nothing was left. Scrubbers in the smoke stacks of the incinerators ensured no chemical agent could be released into the air, the officials said.</p>
<p>Scrubbers are chemical baths that clean chemical agents out of the emissions. They start their work before the emissions get to the smoke stacks but some of them are placed in the smoke stacks, officials said.</p>
<p>Opponents had tried to block the destruction of chemical war agents in the United States on the grounds that emissions were a hazard.</p>
<p>The destruction was held up until last week, when a federal judge rejected a preliminary injunction requested by the Kentucky-based Chemical Weapons Working Group.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Tena Campbell ruled the opponents had not shown emissions would be a risk. &quot;For individuals living closest (to the Tooele facility), the risks resulting from continued storage are one hundred times greater than the risks resulting from disposal operations,&quot; the judge wrote in an opinion.</p>
<p>The munitions are stored in dirt-covered bunkers built with reinforced steel. About 42 percent of the Army's lethal chemical weapons are kept at Tooele.</p>
<p>Other sites are in Colorado, Oregon, Arkansas, Alabama, Kentucky, Indiana and Maryland, along with the munitions site on Johnston Atoll.</p>
<p>Defense officials said many of the weapons were obsolete -- the M-55 rockets no longer have launchers, for example -- and some have leaked but are in stockpiles where even leaking weapons can be safely handled.</p>
<p>The M-55 rockets are filled with GB nerve agent, a colorless, odorless liquid resembling water, and equipped with explosive agents designed to burst when the rocket is over its target. The liquid, once released, vaporises before incapacitating or killing its victims.</p>
<p>The Defense Department disclosed in January for the first time that the U.S. arsenal had 3.3 million single-chemical bombs, rockets, artillery shells and cartridges and 315,682 binary weapons. The binary weapons hold chemicals in separate chambers and mix them into deadly gas in flight.</p>
<p>Former President George Bush announced in 1991 that the United States would no longer use chemical weapons and called for the elimination of the country's arsenal. Congress agreed and passed legislation requiring the destruction of the arsenal by 2004.</p>
