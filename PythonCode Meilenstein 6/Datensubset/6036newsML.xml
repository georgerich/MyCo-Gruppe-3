<p>Prices of Russian MinFin bonds fell in nervous trading on Wednesday, with the market unsettled by rumours, denied by a finance ministry official, that some new bonds had been frozen, dealers said.</p>
<p>		 tranche  Aug 21		  Aug 20</p>
<p> 1999 maturity (3)    75.50-75.80	   76.15-76.45</p>
<p> 2003 maturity (4)    48.50-48.80	   49.30-49.60</p>
<p> 2008 maturity (5)    31.50-31.80	   32.35-33.65</p>
<p> 2006 maturity (6)    37.80-38.10	   37.80-38.10</p>
<p> 2011 maturity (7)    28.40-28.70	   28.40-28.70</p>
<p>&quot;These rumours should be checked out carefully, but such information is enough to drive the market down,&quot; an ICFI Moscow Partners bank dealer said.</p>
<p>But a finance ministry official who declined to be named told Reuters on Wednesday that no new bonds had been frozen.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not have such information (about freezing new bonds), there is nothing new about this matter,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>An International Moscow bank dealer said &quot;There are few bids on the market, just offers, with some banks not quoting at all.&quot;</p>
<p>Dealers said the market could also be nervous about the health of President Boris Yeltsin and the extent to which he is in control.</p>
<p>&quot;Somebody may be affected by it, but the fall may be also due to a correction after (last week's) rise,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>The presidential press service said earlier that Yeltsin, resting in north-western Russia, had signed two decrees today.</p>
