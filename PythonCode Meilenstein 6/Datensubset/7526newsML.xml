<p>Three blasts damaged public buildings and a villa in Corsica early on Wednesday but caused no injuries, taking to seven the number of bombings of state targets in just over a week, police said.</p>
<p>No one has claimed responsibility for the attacks, but Corsican separatists seeking greater autonomy from mainland France have regularly targeted government buildings in a guerrilla campaign that has been going on for two decades.</p>
<p>The first bomb was thrown at 4.30 a.m. (0230 GMT) at a schoolteacher's house in Ville de Pietrabugno near Bastia in the north of the French Mediterranean island. The blast shattered the windows of the villa and other neighbouring homes.</p>
<p>A second blast an hour later damaged offices of the SNCM company in Porto-Vecchio in the south of the island which runs ferry services between Corsica and the mainland.</p>
<p>Four minutes later another bomb caused minor damage at offices of the equipment ministry in the same town.</p>
<p>A senior Corsican politician, fresh from escaping a bomb attack, said on Tuesday the island was headed for a new flare-up of separatist violence which could spread to the mainland.</p>
<p>Former French industry minister Jose Rossi, who heads the elected council of southern Corsica, spoke hours after police defused a bomb on his Ajaccio doorstep.</p>
