<headline>Canadian bonds end mixed, curve flatter after ease.</headline>

<p>Canadian bonds closed mixed on Thursday following a rate cut by the Bank of Canada as investors sold off short-term issues to buy longer-term bonds, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The short end was overdone going into the Bank's easing,&quot; said one Toronto-based bond dealer. &quot;The market had already discounted a quarter point. It was starting to discount more than that and they just took it back.&quot;</p>
<p>Canada's 8.0 percent bond due 2023 rose C$0.25 to C$103.00 to yield 7.731 percent. The U.S. 30-year benchmark fell 2/32 to yield 6.84 percent.  </p>
<p>The spread between the bonds narrowed to 89 basis points from 91 basis points at Wednesday's close.</p>
<p>The Bank of Canada cut its key Bank Rate by 25 basis points to 4.25 percent and lowered the target range for its overnight lending rate to 3.75-4.25 percent on Thursday.</p>
<p>The move by the Bank followed a decision by Germany's Bundesbank to cut short-term interest rates. The Bundesbank's move triggered rate cuts in other European countries.</p>
<p>The Bank of Canada issued a statement following the easing which analysts said suggested the Bank will not lower rates further.  </p>
<p>In the statement, the Bank said the cumulative interest rate cuts now in place are &quot;substantial&quot; and can be expected to have a positive impact on the economy over the next year or so.</p>
<p>Expectations the Bank will not ease again prompted investors to take profits on shorter-term issues and buy longer-term bonds which have more attractive yields, analysts said.</p>
<p>In new issue news, the Government of Canada said it plans to auction on August 28 a total of C$400 million of 4.25 percent real return bonds maturing on Decmeber 1, 2026.  </p>
<p>In other prices, the 7.0 percent of 2006 rose C$0.01 to C$98.20 to yield 7.249 percent. The U.S. 10-year benchmark fell 1/32 to yield 6.62 percent.</p>
<p>The spread between the two bonds narrowed to 63 basis points from 64 basis points at Wednesday's close.</p>
<p>The three-month cash bill traded at 3.99 percent against the U.S. three-month bill at 5.13 percent.</p>
