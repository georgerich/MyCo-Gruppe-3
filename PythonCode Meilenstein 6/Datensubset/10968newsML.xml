<p>Police said on Friday they had arrested a family of four and two other people for South Africa's biggest armed robbery of some 31 million rand ($6.8 million) early this month.</p>
<p>Mounds of banknotes were found when a couple and their two adult children were arrested late on Thursday outside the Indian Ocean port of Durban.</p>
<p>&quot;Detectives recovered six refuse bags and one sports bag containing a substantial amount of cash in their house. A count for the total amount seized is still taking place, it is obviously millions,&quot; a spokesman told a news conference.</p>
<p>The family was being held for questioning and had not been charged, he said.</p>
<p>Two other men in their early 20s were later arrested near Pinetown, the area west of Durban where five gunmen had raided a security firm's cash depot on August 6.</p>
