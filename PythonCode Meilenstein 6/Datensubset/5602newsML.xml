<headline>Latin American debts mixed, Russia sells off.</headline>

<p>Latin American debt prices meandered in directionless trading, while Russia took a pounding by rumors of Minfin bond default, traders said.</p>
<p>A raft of economic data from Latin American countries confirmed the existing trends, without providing new impetus for trading, they said.</p>
<p>Argentine papers got a brief lift by the 7.0 percent rise in July industrial production, but failed to hold on to the gains.</p>
<p>&quot;The figure was actually higher than expected, showing the recovery on track,&quot; said Richard Segal, head of emerging market fixed income research at Santander Investments.  </p>
<p>Sentiments on Argentina turned cautious in the past month as investors watched how the new economy minister Roque Fernadez would tackle the fiscal deficits.</p>
<p>The International Monetary Fund officials in Buenos Aires this week are likely to agree to a &quot;negotiated waiver&quot; on the deficit target, Segal said.</p>
<p>Argentina FRBs and Pars each shed 3/8 to 76-7/8 and 54-1/2.</p>
<p>Brazil industrial production in June rose 0.5 percent from May, but fell 3.9 percent compared to a year ago.  </p>
<p>&quot;Obviously Brazil was not doing as well as Argentina in the second quarter,&quot; said a U.S. bank trader.</p>
<p>Brazil papers were lightly mixed, with Brazil C sliding 1/4 to 64-7/8 while Brazil discount Z adding 1/8 to 71-5/8.</p>
<p>Mexico reported preliminary trade surplus totaled $461, with sharp increases in both exports and imports.</p>
<p>&quot;The figure is as good as it can be,&quot; Santander's Segal said, noting, however, with the peso stubbornly strong, the future of building trade surpluses was not reassuring.  </p>
<p>Rumors, later denied, that another tranche of the Minfin bond is frozen triggered the selloff in Russia before the U.S. trading began.</p>
<p>Positive developments that the IMF agreed to release $330 million, part of a $10.2 billion three-year loan approved in February and a ceasefire with Chechen rebels failed to help trim losses.</p>
<p>&quot;It's the first major seloff,&quot; said the U.S. bank trader. &quot;but it remains to be seen if the sentiments have changed.&quot;</p>
<p>Russia dollar Vnesh fell 1-1/4 59-5/8 and Min Fin 4 lost 1-1/2 to 47-7/8.  </p>
