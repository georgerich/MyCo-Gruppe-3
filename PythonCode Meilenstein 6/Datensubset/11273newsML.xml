<p>Australia's Foreign Minister Alexander Downer announced on Friday an agreement with China to expand their security dialogue, saying recent frictions had failed to spoil growing ties between the two Pacific powers.</p>
<p>Disagreement over Taiwan, a coming meeting with the Dalai Lama and Chinese concerns over a Canberra-Washington security pact had not spoiled the atmosphere during meetings with his Chinese counterparts, Downer told a news conference in Beijing.</p>
<p>&quot;I have been able to develop a security dialogue between Australia and China,&quot; he said. &quot;What I would like to see happen is us holding, on an annual basis, senior officials' talks about regional security issues.&quot;</p>
<p>Downer said an Australian proposal for broadening existing annual bilateral disarmament talks into such a dialogue had been accepted by Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, but he gave no details of how they were likely to be organised.</p>
<p>&quot;It's symbolically important because it reaffirms ... that the Australian government does not support a policy of containment of China,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Downer's coming meeting with the Dalai Lama, Beijing's arch-rival for the loyalties of the Tibetan people, had not been a sticking point in talks with Premier Li Peng, he said.</p>
<p>Beijing regards the Dalai Lama as an anti-China &quot;splittist&quot;, and condemns all attempts by Tibet's supreme spiritual leader to gather international support for autonomy in the restive Himalayan region.</p>
<p>Downer said he would meet the Dalai Lama when he arrived in Australia next month, but said the Chinese premier had made no direct mention of the visit.</p>
<p>A defence pact in July between Washington and Canberra that raised hackles in Beijing had not been brought up as a Chinese concern, while a proposal to supply uranium to Beijing's rival Taiwan was far from becoming a reality that could disrupt growing ties, he said.</p>
<p>Australian officials said Downer had fulfilled a pledge made last month in Hong Kong to raise the case of jailed Chinese-born Australian businessman James Peng during his Beijing trip.</p>
<p>Peng, 36, was sentenced to 18 years in a Chinese prison last September after being convicted of embezzling about A$240,000 (US$180,000) in the southern city Shenzhen. He has insisted he was framed by powerful commercial rivals.</p>
<p>Downer had requested that China deport Peng before the end of his scheduled term, but had been told the prisoner's sentence was a matter for the judiciary to decide, officials said.</p>
