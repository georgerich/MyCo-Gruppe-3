<p>Zurich FC gave themselves a 100th anniversary gift on Wednesday when they acquired Swedish striker Thomas Brolin on loan from English premier league club Leeds United for the rest of the season.</p>
<p>The move ends a frustrating period in England for Brolin, who commanded a club record transfer fee of $6.8 million when Leeds obtained him from Italian Serie A side Parma last November but ended up on the substitutes' bench.</p>
<p>Brolin is scheduled to arrive in Zurich on Thursday and make his Swiss league debut in Berne on September 4 against Young Boys.</p>
<p>No details on the transfer were released but club president Sven Hotz said: &quot;We were only able to acquire the Swede thanks to an exceptional offer from abroad.&quot;</p>
<p>Zurich, currently fifth in the Swiss premier division with nine goals in as many games, will be hoping that the 26-year-old striker, who has 26 goals in 46 internationals, can ignite their attack.</p>
<p>Once considered one of the most spectacular players in Europe, Brolin led Sweden to third place at the 1994 World Cup in the United States and Parma to the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1993.</p>
<p>But, plagued by injuries and a lack of fitness, Brolin never displayed the form that was expected of him with Leeds and had to settle eventually for the role of substitute.</p>
<p>He missed the final two games of last season when he returned to Sweden to have an operation on his ankle.</p>
