<p>A Russian foreign ministry spokesman on Thursday rejected criticism from the international community over its forces' attacks on the Chechen capital Grozny, recalling that the rebels started the latest fighting.</p>
<p>Foreign ministry spokesman Mikhail Demurin told a news briefing that criticism &quot;should be addressed to those who started these (military) actions&quot;, Interfax news agency said.</p>
<p>He was speaking a day after U.S. President Bill Clinton appealed to President Boris Yeltsin to end the violence in Chechnya and promote a peaceful dialogue.</p>
<p>&quot;This cycle of violence must come to an end because prolonged fighting is only going to endanger civilians,&quot; White House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters in Washington on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Itar-Tass news agency said of Demurin's reaction: &quot;Talking about the disappointment caused by the renewed military activities in Chechnya expressed in particular by America, the diplomat advised them to remember who renewed the military actions and how the situation began.&quot;</p>
<p>Fighting flared in Grozny after the rebels seized the city on August 6. Hundreds of people have been killed and tens of thousands have fled the city since then.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, a Russian general gave civilians 48 hours to escape before an all-out attack. The attack, expected on Thursday did not materialise, but Moscow's aircraft and artillery pounded Grozny on Wednesday to try to oust the rebels.</p>
<p>Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy had urged the two sides to negotiate. &quot;The high toll the fighting has exacted on civilians is of particular concern to Canada. We urge both sides to spare no effort in protecting their safety,&quot; he said in an August 20 statement faxed to Reuters on Thursday.</p>
<p>A senior German diplomat visited Moscow on Wednesday to press home Bonn's growing alarm about the situation in Grozny and urge Russia to halt its military campaign. The European Union had also appealed to both sides to cease fire immediately.</p>
<p>Despite a series of truces and peace deals, fighting has raged on and off ever since Yeltsin sent in his forces to crush Chechnya's independence bid in December 1994. More than 30,000 people, most of them civilians, have been killed.</p>
<p>Demurin said the foreign ministry was paying close attention to criticism abroad, but added that security chief Alexander Lebed was in full control of the situation.</p>
<p>Tass quoted him as saying it could be hoped that a political solution would be found as a result of moves by Lebed, holding his second day of talks with rebels in the mainly Moslem region.</p>
