<p>China said on Wednesday it was voicing its concern to Ukraine over a visit by Vice President Lien Chan of Taiwan.</p>
<p>&quot;The Chinese government is now in the process of making representations with the Ukrainian government,&quot; a Foreign Ministry spokesman told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;China firmly opposes any country with diplomatic ties with it developing any official relations or having any official contacts with Taiwan,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Lien's recent trip to Ukraine to accept an honorary degree from the University of Kiev was made with ulterior, political motives, according to the spokesman.</p>
<p>Lien emerged in Kiev on Tuesday, two days after vanishing on a mysterious European mission, raising the prospect of diplomatic sparks between Ukraine and communist China.</p>
<p>Taiwan Television showed Lien with his wife and other Taiwan and Ukraine officials posing at the University of Kiev, where the announcer said Lien had received an honorary degree.</p>
<p>State-funded television said Lien's secretive visit had been arranged by the university, indicating it was unofficial, but said Lien had met Ukrainian officials and was awaiting a possible meeting with President Leonid Kuchma.</p>
<p>The spokesman said Ukraine's acceptance of Lien's visit has constituted a grave violation of its commitment made on the question of Taiwan in the communique on the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and Ukraine.</p>
<p>Ukraine, a former Soviet republic, recognises the communist government in Beijing -- not Taiwan's exiled Republic of China. But it has made clear its desire for improved relations with Taiwan, one of Asia's economic powerhouses.</p>
<p>China regards Nationalist-ruled Taiwan as a rebel province and has sought to isolate the island diplomatically since a civil war separated them in 1949.</p>
<p>Any attempt by the Taiwan authorities to create &quot;two Chinas&quot; or &quot;one China, one Taiwan&quot; is doomed to failure, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>&quot;Two Chinas&quot; and &quot;one China, one Taiwan&quot; are euphemisms for Taiwan's Nationalist government abandoning its avowed goal of reunification and seeking independence.</p>
<p>Ukraine's embassy in Beijing declined to comment.  </p>
<p>The delegation, headed by a member of China's powerful State Council, was to have visited Ukraine from August 21 to 26. Meetings with President Leonid Kuchma and Prime Minister Pavlo Lazarenko were planned.</p>
<p>A foreign ministry spokesman in Beijing said China was voicing its concern to Ukraine over a visit by Lien of Taiwan, who arrived in Kiev on Tuesday. China regards Nationalist-ruled Taiwan as a rebel province and has sought to isolate the island diplomatically since a civil war separated them in 1949.</p>
<p>The Chinese spokesman said Lien's trip to Ukraine to accept an honorary degree from the University of Kiev was made with political motives. In Kiev, the diplomat said China's ambassador to Ukraine had protested to the foreign ministry about Lien's visit and informed it the trip had been cancelled.</p>
<p>Ukrainian officials could not be immediately contacted for reaction. They have insisted that Lien's visit was a private one and that the Ukrainian government had nothing to do with his presence in the country.</p>
