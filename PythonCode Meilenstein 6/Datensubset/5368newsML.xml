<p>Ally McCoist scored his second hat-trick in four days as Glasgow Rangers overwhelmed Russian champions Alania Vladikavkaz 7-2 in the away leg of their European Cup qualifying round tie on Wednesday.</p>
<p>They moved into the first round group matches on a 10-3 aggregate.</p>
<p>McCoist carried on where left off in the 5-2 Scottish premier division win over Dunfermline on Saturday, when he scored a second half hat-trick, with three strikes in the opening 19 minutes against the Russian side.</p>
<p>McCoist's first, a header, came in the opening minute. His second in the 13th minute was another header and his third from close range took the predatory 33-year-old's tally for the new season to eight.</p>
<p>Dane Brian Laudrup scored twice for Rangers as did Rapid Vienna's Bulgarian international Trifon Ivanov in the 4-2 away win over Dynamo Kiev.</p>
<p>Ivanov's goals in the 23rd and 42nd minutes helped last season's beaten European Cup Winners' Cup finalists to a 6-2 aggregate win.</p>
<p>Augustine Okacha scored for Fenerbahce in the 18th minute but the Turkish champions were made to sweat by Maccabi Tel Aviv before drawing 1-1 on the night, giving them a 2-1 aggregate triumph.  </p>
<p>Steaua Bucharest's Adrian Ilie had a night of mixed emotions as the 1986 European champions cruised into the next phase with a 5-2 aggregate win over Club Brugge of Belgium.</p>
<p>Ilie scored twice and laid on the third goal in the 3-0 second leg win.</p>
<p>But his celebrations were cut short in the 56th minute when he was sent off by Italian referee Pierluigi Collina for a tackle from behind.</p>
<p>Ilie's first goal came from a penalty in the 36th minute. Goalkeeper Danny Verlinden parried his spot kick but Ilie rammed home at the second attempt.</p>
<p>A powerful shot from the edge of the area brought him his second a minute before halftime and he set up Roland Nagy for the third just 60 seconds before being sent off.</p>
<p>IFK Gothenburg also cruised into the group stage, a 1-1 draw in their away leg against Ferencvaros of Hungary earning them a 4-1 aggregate win.</p>
<p>Ferenc Horvath gave Ferencvaros the lead with a header after 15 minutes but the home side failed to convert their superior first-half possession into further goals.</p>
<p>The Swedes controlled much of the second half and equalised three minutes from the end when Andreas Andersson broke clear and drove home from inside the box.</p>
<p>Widzew Lodz snatched victory over Danish champions Brondby on the away goals rule when Pawel Wojtala scored their second goal in the 89th minute.</p>
<p>The Polish side lost 3-2 on the night but Wojtala's goal brought the scores level 4-4 on aggregate.</p>
<p>Brondby had appeared set for the next round when goals by Peter Moeller, Ole Bjur and Kim Vilfort put them 3-0 ahead -- 4-2 on aggregate -- by the 48th minute.</p>
<p>But Marek Citko sparked the Poles' revival with a goal in the 56th minute.</p>
