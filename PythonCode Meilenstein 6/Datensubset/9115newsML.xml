<p>Security chief Alexander Lebed met separatists in a Chechen rebel-held village on Thursday and their talks were said to be making progress after a deadline for a Russian assault on Grozny passed quietly.</p>
<p>Lebed held his second day of talks as it became clear Russian generals had not carried out their threat to bombard the Chechen capital, held by rebels for more than two weeks.</p>
<p>There was no sign of major military activity during the morning in Grozny, which suffered a pounding by Moscow's forces on Wednesday. In the village of Novye Atagi, some 20 km (12 miles) further south, the talks were said to be going well.</p>
<p>Lebed's press spokesman Alexander Barkhatov told reporters the two sides were working out a &quot;day-by-day schedule&quot; to stop fighting which has raged on and off for more than 20 months. &quot;The talks are being conducted in a good atmosphere,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>A document was being prepared, he said.</p>
<p>Interfax news agency said it was a nine-point deal which addressed first of all the situation in Grozny, then separating the two sides, stopping looting and averting further clashes.</p>
<p>Lebed and Maskhadov were interrupted several times to look into incidents of fighting in the region, Interfax said.</p>
<p>More than 30,000 people have been killed in the North Caucasus region since President Boris Yeltsin sent his forces to crush its independence drive in December 1994.</p>
<p>The latest fighting has killed many hundreds and sent tens of thousands fleeing. Expectations that Grozny would be bombed on Thursday, after a Russian commander issued an ultimatum to rebels who have seized the city, sparked a fresh exodus.</p>
<p>Lebed said he had halted the assault after 11th-hour talks with rebel leaders on Wednesday night. But the generals in the field appear to have had clear differences with Yeltsin's security adviser as well as with their own defence minister.</p>
<p>Explosions occasionally echoed across the countryside around Grozny, but they were far fewer than on Wednesday, when a sporadic air and artillery bombardment went on for hours.</p>
<p>The separatists, broadcasting on rebel television in their mostly-Moslem region, were announcing Russia had capitulated and calling on supporters of the Moscow-backed government to join them, Ekho Moskvy quoted official pro-Moscow sources as saying.</p>
<p>&quot;The separatists are addressing the supporters of the legal government of the Chechen republic with threats and demands that they cross over to the rebel side,&quot; it quoted the Chechen government's representative in Moscow as saying.</p>
<p>Four Russian servicemen were killed, 18 wounded and three taken prisoner in Chechnya on Thursday, Interfax said. Itar-Tass news agency said six had also been killed in Grozny overnight.</p>
<p>No casualty figures were available for the rebels, or for the civilians cowering in cellars to escape the fighting.</p>
<p>The Red Cross estimated on Wednesday that about 120,000 were left in Grozny. A similar number had fled in the last two weeks.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, target of speculation over his health as factions vie for position over Chechnya, returned to the Kremlin on Thursday after a brief break and met his new health minister.</p>
<p>Lebed went back to the same southern Chechen village where he had talks the previous night and promised to try to end the conflict and demilitarise Grozny.</p>
<p>&quot;We have gathered here with the firm intention of achieving something worthwhile. We are going to discuss the issues of how to separate the troops and give Grozny the status of a demilitarised city.&quot;</p>
<p>Lebed said on Wednesday he had agreed a ceasefire with rebel chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov and declared the Russian military's threat to flatten Grozny would not happen.</p>
<p>The Russian military, humiliated by the separatists' takeover of Grozny on August 6, had accused the rebels of using a previous ceasefire to strengthen positions.</p>
