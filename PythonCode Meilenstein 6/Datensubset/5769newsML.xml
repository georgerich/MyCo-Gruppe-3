<p>Copper prices withered during a slow summer session on Wednesday morning, pressured by easier spreads and most of the other metals drifted down in sympathy.</p>
<p>Copper spreads came in further during the morning rings, with cash/threes last at a $38/$42 backwardation compared to $45 on Tuesday and over $100 last month.</p>
<p>September dates easied too, but remained a tight area of the curve, with September/threes last traded at a $38 backwardation, down $4.</p>
<p>Three months prices slid most of the morning, but ended $4 above its low of $1,915 per tonne, finishing the midsession kerb with a $12 loss on the day.</p>
<p>Analysts and traders were mixed about the direction, with some convinced that the market would soon see a test of the floor of the $1,900-1,970 range.</p>
<p>&quot;The recent rally has been met with good trade lending and outright selling, and there does not seem to be the strength to bolster the market back up,&quot; said broker GNI in a commentary.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a strong feeling that the spreads, and therefore the market, could collapse in the near future,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>But chartist Harry Creates of broker AMT said the market has been trading in an up-channel since the June $1,745 low. Key trend support was pegged at $1,915 and a close below this level would be bearish.</p>
<p>&quot;However, there is an ascending triangle within the channel at $1,970. The upside is favoured,&quot; he said in a report.</p>
<p>Aluminium barely moved, finishing the kerb unchanged at $1,489 per tonne after trading in a $4 range, remaining stuck within a $1,480-$1,500 price band. Alloy however was lower at $1,285, down $10.</p>
<p>Many technical analysts favoured a test of aluminium's downside, with prices languishing below short-term moving averages.</p>
<p>Nickel edged down despite favourable technical signals, ending the morning at $7,160, down $25.</p>
<p>Prices formed a bullish outside day on Tuesday and the 10-day moving average crossed above the 30-day average. But any upside momentum &quot;is likely to peter out unless levels above $7,200/50 are seen&quot;, broker Brandeis said.</p>
<p>Zinc slipped after a weak close on Tuesday, finishing the kerb at $1,022, down $9.</p>
<p>&quot;The vulnerable chart picture suggests a possible move back towards $1,010/15.  Any sell-off is likely to be short-lived and technically inspired as fundamentally zinc seems to be relatively tight,&quot; said broker Rudolf Wolff in a daily report.</p>
<p>Lead lost $8.50 to end the morning at support of $815.50, and tin shed $20 to $6,140.</p>
