<p>A home-made bomb exploded in a market in the district of Tipasa west of the Algerian capital Algiers on Friday, killing three women and two children, Algerian security forces said.</p>
<p>Five people were injured, they added in a statement carried by the Algerian news agency APS.</p>
<p>The security forces said they defused four other bombs in a raid immediately after the explosion.</p>
<p>They added that a man carrying an explosive device died after it went off prematurely.</p>
<p>&quot;One of the criminals who planted the bombs was killed by a bomb he was carrying,&quot; Algerian radio quoted the security forces as saying.</p>
<p>An estimated 50,000 Algerians and more than 110 foreigners have been killed in violence pitting Moslem rebels against government forces since early 1992, when the authorities cancelled a general election in which radical Islamists had taken a commanding lead.</p>
