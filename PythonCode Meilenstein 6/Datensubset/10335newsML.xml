<title>JAPAN: Japan to boost subsidies to nuclear plant hosts.</title>

<p>Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) said on Friday it would increase subsidies to local governments which host nuclear power plants, in a bid to promote construction of more such plants.</p>
<p>&quot;In recent years it has become increasingly difficult to obtain land to build nuclear power plants,&quot; a MITI official said. &quot;It is vital to gain local understanding,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>MITI has asked for 5.12 billion yen ($47.4 million) to be appropriated for the purpose in the budget for fiscal 1997/98 starting next April 1, he said.</p>
<p>Annual subsidies to local governments with nuclear power plants will be raised to 80 million yen ($740,000) per one million kilowatts.</p>
<p>The MITI official said local governments would be allowed to use the subsidies to invite businesses to set up in their region and to support social welfare.</p>
<p>Under the current system, only economically poor areas receive subsidies, of 40 million yen ($370,000) per nuclear reactor, on condition the reactors have been operating for more than 15 years. The subsidies can be used only for social welfare.</p>
<p>The decision to increase the subsidies comes at a time when the realisation of Japan's nuclear power policy has come increasingly into doubt.</p>
<p>Public faith in nuclear power crumbled last year after an accident at Japan's first prototype fast-breeder reactor.</p>
<p>Confidence was further eroded when officials in charge of the reactor acknowledged that they had failed to disclose video footage and other information on the accident. The accident involved a leakage of sodium coolant, though not of radiation, officials said.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, in Japan's first ever referendum, a small northern town of 30,000 people returned a majority &quot;no&quot; vote against the construction of a nuclear plant. However, the result is not legally binding.</p>
<p>Japan relies on nuclear reactors for 33 percent of its electricity and plans to raise this reliance to 42 percent by 2010. ($1=108 yen)</p>
