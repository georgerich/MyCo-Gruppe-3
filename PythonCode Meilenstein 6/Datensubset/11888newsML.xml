<p>A state senator is seeking a probe into allegations of financial improprieties by one of Boston's top advertising agencies in connection with two state contracts it won, The Boston Globe reported on Friday.</p>
<p>Senator Diane Wilkerson asked in a letter to the Massachusetts inspector general to determine the validity of allegations leveled against Houston Herstek Favat, Inc, by a former executive who said he was fired by the agency because he is gay, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>Houston Herstek landed a five-year, $11 million-a-year contract from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health to implement part of the state's anti-smoking campaign. It also has a multimillion-dollar contract from the state's Office of Travel and Tourism.</p>
<p>The former executive filed a gender discrimination complaint against Houston Hertek earlier this week in which he alleged the agency &quot;donated&quot; $20,000 to the American Cancer Society with the understanding the society would use half the money to help the agency secure the anti-smoking contract.</p>
<p>Representatives from Houston Herstek, Wilkerson and Inspector General Robert Cerasoli were not immediately available for comment.</p>
