<p>Greek depos and forex swaps were trading slightly lower after the central bank's 20-basis-point cut in its overnight intervention rate to 12.60 percent around mid-session and elections formally declared for September 22.</p>
<p>&quot;Rates eased further after the central bank's intervention rate cut in overnight funds and have stabilised since then,&quot; said a trader at a foreign bank. &quot;Current levels might hold for a while.&quot;</p>
<p>The Bank of Greece reduced its intervention rate for overnight funds to 12.60 percent from 12.80 percent on the back of the Bundesbank's repo rate cut on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;The central bank decided to slash its intervention bid rate in overnight funds by 20 basis points to 12.60 percent, in line with other European central banks such as Denmark's and Finland's this morning,&quot; a high-level Bank of Greece official told Reuters.</p>
<p>Other traders said forex market developments will affect liquidity and be a decisive factor along with pre-election events in determining the future course of interest rates.</p>
<p>Greek President Costis Stephnopoulos signed a decree on Thursday ordering dissolution of the 300-seat parliament ahead of early elections on September 22, a presidency statement said.</p>
<p>Socialist Prime Minister Costas Simitis also announced on Thursday the snap poll, citing problems with the economy, the country's convergence with the European Union and tense relations with neighbouring rival Turkey.</p>
<p>Dealers predicted a 20- or 30-basis-point cut in the 12-month T-bill rate by the finance ministry at end-August.</p>
<p>The mark was quoted at 159.50/60 drachmas from Friday's 159.510 fix, the dollar at 238.05/15 drachmas from 237.710 and the Ecu at 300.42/52 from 300.600 drachmas.</p>
<p>The National Bank of Greece, the domestic money market's biggest player, quoted the following late rates:</p>
<p>** Overnight at 12.40-12.70</p>
<p>** T/N at 12.20-12.70</p>
<p>** S/N at 12.20-12.70</p>
<p>** One week at 12.25-12.75</p>
<p>** Two weeks at 12.30-12.80</p>
