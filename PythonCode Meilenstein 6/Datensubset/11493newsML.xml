<p>Italy has not yet defeated inflation but latest data pointing to a further slowdown in price rises this month was comforting, Prime Minister Romano Prodi said in a television interview on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;The fight against inflation is very important. We still haven't beaten it definitively. We have won battles but not the war,&quot; Prodi told the private TMC station. &quot;However the latest figures were pleasing,&quot; he added. </p>
<p>Provisional data released earlier this week showed inflation at between 3.3 and 3.4 percent year-on-year in August against 3.6 percent in July.</p>
<p>&quot;The fall in inflation is only in a small part due to low (domestic) demand,&quot; Prodi said, adding that he expected to see a gradual pick-up in both the Italian and European economy.</p>
<p>The prime minister said his government would now turn its attention to defeating unemployment and working on the 1997 budget. -- Rome newsroom +396 6782501</p>
