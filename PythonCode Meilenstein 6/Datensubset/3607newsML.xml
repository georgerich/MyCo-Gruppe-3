<p>Egyptian share prices leaped to a 17-month high on Tuesday on strong demand for milling shares and other popular recent issues.</p>
<p>Volume was a heavy 40.87 million pounds ($12 million), but much of that came from the registration of newly privatised shares in Nasr Match and Prefabricated Houses and Misr Oil and Soap, brokers said.</p>
<p>The Capital Market Authority (CMA) overall index rose 1.83 points to 233.55, its highest level since May 1995.</p>
<p>North Cairo Flour Mills led the way up on rumours that it would pay a dividend of at least 12.00 pounds for the financial year which ended on June 30, against 4.92 pounds for the previous year. The shares closed 5.75 pounds up at 95.25.</p>
<p>South Cairo Flour Mills and Central Egypt Flour Mills also rose, by 1.60 pounds to 40.85 and 0.50 to 24.50 respectively, the CMA said.</p>
<p>&quot;These milling firms have a P/E ratio of five so they're undervalued even by the standards of the Cairo market,&quot; said broker Elwi Taimour of Financial Brokerage Group.</p>
<p>Commercial International Bank (CIB) climbed 4.00 pounds to 445.00 on good performance by its recently floated GDR and expectations that a 10-for-1 share split will encourage trading by making the shares more liquid, the brokers said.</p>
<p>A shareholders meeting on August 31 is expected to discuss the share split proposal, they added.</p>
<p>Paints and Chemical Industries/PACHIN, which will hold a shareholders meeting on Wednesday, rose on similar expectations of a share split, said Neveen El Tahry of Delta Stockbrokers. It closed 12.00 pounds higher at 790.00.</p>
<p>The CMA index for openly traded firms rose to 337.35 points from 330.04 points on Monday. The index for the rarely traded &quot;closed&quot; firms was unchanged at 160.08 points.</p>
<p>Advances outnumbered declines by 24 to 22.</p>
