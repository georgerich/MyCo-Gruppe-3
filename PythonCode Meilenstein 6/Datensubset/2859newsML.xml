<headline>US mortgage-backeds mixed, tighter to Treasuries.</headline>

<p>U.S. mortgage-backed securities were mixed on Tuesday afternoon after the Federal Reserve concluded its policy meeting with no announcement on interest rates.</p>
<p>Pass-throughs were unchanged to 2/32 higher in very light trading, traders said. Discount coupons lost their early gains -- about 3/32 -- while premiums generally held on.</p>
<p>Yields over Treasuries narrowed two to three basis points.</p>
<p>Treasuries slipped modestly after the Federal Open Market Committee meeting, but fixed-income analysts said government securities had been well-positioned ahead of the meeting.  </p>
<p>Late on Tuesday, GNMA 30-year 7.5 percent coupons were up 1/32 at 99-05/32, yielding 110 basis points over 10-year Treasuries.</p>
<p>Comparable FNMAs were up 1/32 at 99-08/32. And FHLMC 30-year 7.5 percent pass-throughs were unchanged at 99-10/32.</p>
<p>With the FOMC behind them, analysts said the August employment report, set for release September 6, becomes the market's next focus.</p>
<p>While only three of 29 economists polled on Tuesday said the Fed will raise rates next month, several experts said payrolls could sway their interest rate forecasts.</p>
