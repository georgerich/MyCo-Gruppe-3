<p>Russia's sugar trade shrugged off government plans to levy quotas on whites, saying on Wednesday that the large quotas being debated would have little effect on an already glutted market.</p>
<p>&quot;It will not change anything. One and a half million tonnes is a very high quota,&quot; said one Western trader.</p>
<p>Traders saw little movement from low prices given strong stocks of sugar, a forecast of an average Russian sugar beet harvest and the fact that any quota, if agreed, was unlikely to restrict imports seriously over the next year.</p>
<p>Wholesale prices of whites are depressed at $435-$470 per tonne, down from a year-ago peak of about $650, traders said.</p>
<p>A government commission called last week for a 1.5 million tonne quota on whites for 1996 and 1997, including one million tonnes for Ukraine and 500,000 for the rest of the world, though no decision has been made or timing announced.</p>
<p>Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Zaveryukha said on Tuesday work on a quota was under way, but would be negotiated with Ukraine, Russia's primary source of imported whites.</p>
<p>A Russian trader said the quota, supported by Agriculture Minister Viktor Khlystun, was primarily a political question and would not be worked out soon.</p>
<p>&quot;Before you can work out the trade questions, you have to work out foreign economic questions,&quot; he said, referring to Russia-Ukraine bilateral relations.</p>
<p>&quot;Wholesale prices will probably not rise, and they might go down a bit for seasonal reasons in September,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>He said the only significance of a quota would be to set a precedent for further cuts in Ukrainian imports.</p>
<p>&quot;First they could put on the quota, and then there would be the question of decreasing the size,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Crucial details of a proposed quota are unclear.</p>
<p>&quot;So far we have no clue how the quota would be implemented -- first come first serve or to get licences. A licence would be best, but it is against the rules of the CIS,&quot; said a trader.</p>
<p>Cheap Ukrainian whites have flooded the market, although Ukraine said last week it would only export about one million tonnes of whites from the present crop next year, about half this year's level.</p>
<p>Proposed exports are the same level as the quota suggested by the government commission.</p>
<p>In the past year Russia's sugar supply has improved sharply and it has built up a buffer stock of whites.</p>
<p>&quot;At the beginning of August (Russia had) one million tonnes of whites reserves, which is huge compared to last year and is probably one of the reasons the market is not moving,&quot; said the Western trader.</p>
<p>SovEcon Ltd independent commodities analyst Andrei Sizov said the typical Russian family has about 50 kilos of sugar on hand to take it through the preserve-making season.</p>
<p>Russia's sugar refineries are idle, having processed imported raws, and are now gearing up for the imminent domestic beet harvest, traders said.</p>
