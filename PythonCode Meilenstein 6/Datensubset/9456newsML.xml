<p>Syria on Thursday said Israel's offer of peace talks was not serious and it was really preparing for military confrontation with Syria.</p>
<p>Official radio said Syria would not abandon its demand for the return of the Golan Heights, captured by Israel in 1967, and urged the United States to prevent the Middle East from exploding.</p>
<p>&quot;No one in the world takes the Israeli government's talk of resuming peace negotiations seriously, especially that the head of the government (Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu) every day announces his readiness for talks with no preconditions,&quot; the political commentary said.</p>
<p>&quot;These preconditions which he rejects are the international security resolutions which call for Israel's withdrawal from the occupied Arab lands,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>Amid mounting tension between the two nations, Israel on Wednesday sent Syria a message, via Washington, saying it was committed to peace and wanted to open negotiations without preconditions.</p>
<p>Syria and Israel accused each other this week of escalating tension. Israeli television reported on Monday that Damascus had recently test fired a Scud C missile able to hit most cities in the Jewish state.</p>
<p>Israel on Tuesday tested its U.S.-funded Arrow 2 missile, saying it successfully intercepted a target missile.</p>
<p>&quot;Netanyahu threatened Syria and Lebanon with aggression.., saying it would be very hard and Israeli officials accompanied that with talks of Syria's armaments. The aim of this talk is very clear as it is one of Israel's traditional ways of preparing for aggression,&quot; Syrian radio said.</p>
<p>Netanyahu, during a tour of Israel's south Lebanon occupation zone earlier this week warned that Israel would reply to attacks on Israeli soldiers there.</p>
<p>&quot;The tension which the Israeli government has been spreading since it took office could destroy everything... as it continues to implement its anti-peace and anti-Arab policies... and insists that it will not withdraw from the Golan,&quot; the radio said.</p>
<p>&quot;The peace sponsors (the U.S. and Russia) should shoulder their responsibilites to save the peace process from collapse. The failure of that would mean a threat to the security of the peoples of the region,&quot; the radio said.</p>
<p>Syrian newspapers earlier on Thursday turned down Israel's offer to resume peace talks, saying negotiations could only be based on an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan.</p>
<p>&quot;Syria will never negotiate for the sake of negotiations and will not be dragged into the trap of talks 'with no preconditions', which simply means holding talks that are not based on any principle and allowing Netanyahu to say the Golan is an Israeli land,&quot; the official newspaper Tishreen said.</p>
<p>Talks between Syria and Israel were suspended following a wave of Moslem suicide attacks in Israel in February and March when Damascus refused to condemn the attacks.</p>
