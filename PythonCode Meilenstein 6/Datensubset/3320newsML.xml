<p>Four people, including an 11-year-old girl, were shot to death execution-style in their home in a working class Sao Paulo suburb, police said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The attack early on Tuesday in Guarulhos was the latest in a spate of violent crimes that has shattered middle-class tranquility in South America's largest city.</p>
<p>A police detective said Raimundo Oliveira da Silva, 44, his wife Sandra, 25, daughter Solange and friend Jonas Carvalho Setti, 33, were slain when five or six men broke into their home and opened fire.</p>
<p>Three others were injured in the hail of bullets, the detective said. Two small children escaped injury.</p>
<p>News reports said Da Silva's 21-year-old son was a key suspect, but police would not confirm the reports.</p>
<p>The slayings were the city's 33rd multiple homocide this year, representing more than 600 deaths, radio and television reports said.</p>
