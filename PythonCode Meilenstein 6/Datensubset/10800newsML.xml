<p>U.S. Mid-Atlantic spot electricity was trading steady to lower Friday on forecasts of below-normal temperatures through to the end of August and speculation there may be little summer heat left to boost air conditioner use, industry sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;Winter is here,&quot; said one East Coast-based physicals trader, who added the market could see price hikes into September if the East experiences any late heatwaves.</p>
<p>Prices in the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) power pool for firm, on peak delivery over the weekend were talked in the $18.00-19.00 range, while Monday power was talked at $21.00-22.00. Next-day power was discussed at $29.00-31.00 per megawatt hour (MWh) on Thursday.</p>
<p>Off-peak power for the weekend was assessed at $14.00-16.00 per MWh.</p>
<p>Power for the five business days of next week was assessed lower in the $20.00-22.00 range from talk at $21.00-22.00 on Thursday, the brokers and marketers said.</p>
<p>September PJM for firm, peak delivery, was discussed relatively steady to slightly higher at $21.50-22.35 from a range of $21.50-22.00 on Thursday. PJM power for the fourth quarter of 1996 was talked at $22.30-22.50, the sources said.</p>
