<p>It was high noon in the Chechen capital Grozny on Friday but the gunmen decided not to draw.</p>
<p>A ceasefire had just taken effect. A few Russian military helicopters circled overhead firing the occasional flare. Separatist rebels patrolled the streets and hundreds of refugees took advantage of the lull to revisit their homes.</p>
<p>Few people believed that the relative calm would last long. After almost two years of war, the cemeteries in this rebellious North Caucasus region are full of mothers crying over freshly-dug mounds.</p>
<p>Aisa Abdulazimova, 42, was tending the grave of her only son against a background of thick black smoke billowing up from fires in oil storage areas of Grozny's main industrial zone.</p>
<p>&quot;Look at that, they have no thought for the mothers,&quot; she said, weeping as she remembered her 23-year-old son who was killed early last year in the first weeks of the war.</p>
<p>&quot;They never stop digging here.&quot;</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of people have been killed since Moscow sent troops to Chechnya in December 1994 to crush its three-year bid for independence. Hundreds perished in a rebel offensive on Grozny this month, and the fight isn't over yet.</p>
<p>Russian security chief Alexander Lebed struck a peace deal this week with rebel chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov, but warriors on both sides still have itchy trigger fingers.</p>
<p>In Grozny, bearded rebel fighters wielding Kalashnikovs and grenade-launchers remained in control of much of the city. But tension was high and occasional firefights broke out even within minutes of the midday truce starting.</p>
<p>A T-72 tank, captured from the Russians eight days ago, stood in a courtyard at a rebel base next door to a city hospital.</p>
<p>The loud hammer of a machinegun nearby sent some of the rebels scurrying to return fire.</p>
<p>Others shrugged it off and continued to play backgammon. &quot;There has been some shooting from their side, but it has been relatively quiet,&quot; said rebel fighter Aslan Shabazov, in camouflage trousers, a white shirt and sunglasses.</p>
<p>The tank, flying the green rebel flag with its black wolf insignia, then swung into action with a roar of its engines, almost knocking down a tree as it reversed out of the yard throwing up a cloud of dust.</p>
<p>There was a sporadic crack of gunfire from the other side of an adjacent building. Then it all fell quiet. &quot;We are silent, and they are fighting,&quot; Shabazov said.</p>
<p>Inside the rebel headquarters, Moslem fighters rested on beds or on the floor. Some drank tea, others listened to music.</p>
<p>One 18-year-old, Isa Usupov, recited a poem about the laws of war. &quot;Blood for blood. Kindness for kindness,&quot; he said, ending the verse with three chants of &quot;Allahu Akbar&quot; (God is Greatest).</p>
<p>Lyona Eldukayev, 35, stood smoking in the yard with the pockets of his camouflage waistcoat stuffed with grenades. &quot;Yesterday and today have been relatively calm,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the city, there was a tense moment just minutes after midday at a Russian checkpoint. Andrei, one of the soldiers manning the post, told journalists that the ceasefire was being observed.</p>
<p>As he spoke, a group of about 10 separatists, armed to the teeth, jumped out of two passing cars. &quot;What's going on here?&quot; asked a rebel commander who identified himself as Jandar.</p>
<p>Andrei quickly retreated behind the sandbags of his checkpoint as the rebels advanced menacingly. &quot;Bring your commander out here,&quot; Jandar shouted.</p>
<p>But Andrei said he was not there and the rebels left without a shot being fired.</p>
