<p>U.S. mortgage-backed securities narrowed to Treasuries on Friday, with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac pass-throughs outperforming Ginnie Maes.</p>
<p>Prices fell after the morning report on durable goods orders, which showed an overall rise of 1.6 percent in July. Ginnie Mae 30-year pass-throughs traded off 4/32 to 20/32, while Fannie Maes and Freddie Macs were off 6/32 to 19/32.</p>
<p>Trading activity was generally light, traders said.</p>
<p>Treasuries slid farther, with the 30-year bond off more than a point and the 10-year note off about 25/32 late on Friday afternoon.  </p>
<p>Late on Friday, GNMA 30-year 8.0 percent coupons were off 17/32 at 100-25/32, yielding 107 basis points over 10-year Treasuries.</p>
<p>Comparable FNMAs were off 16/32 at 100-21/32, and FHLMCs were off 24/32 at 100-24/32.</p>
<p>Economists said the durables rise signaled strong demand for big-ticket items. &quot;Capital spending is rising and manufacturing is back in an uptrend,&quot; said Astrid Adolfson, senior economist at MCM MoneyWatch Inc.</p>
<p>Next week, the market will get a look at home sales data and revised second-quarter gross domestic product.  </p>
<p>Wall Street economists in a Reuters survey forecast existing homes sales fell to a 4.1 million unit annual rate in July against 4.18 million in June. They projected new home sales fell from 734,000 annualized to 728,000.</p>
<p>The economists forecast revised GDP will be unchanged at 4.2 percent.</p>
