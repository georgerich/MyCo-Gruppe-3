<text>
<p>Lloyd's of London Tuesday braced for a possible ruling in a crucial United States court case that threatens at the last minute to upset a recovery plan for the 300-year-old insurance market.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of investors in Lloyd's worldwide are anxiously awaiting the outcome of the case in Richmond, Va., where U.S. investors, known as Names, have applied for an injunction to block the recovery plan.</p>
<p>Under its rescue proposals, Lloyd's is to reinsure billions of pounds in liabilities, including pollution and asbestos-related claims in the United States, into a new company called Equitas.</p>
<p>Names have only eight days left in which to accept or reject this plan, on which the future of the market hangs.</p>
<p>Since improving the terms of the proposals, which include a 3.2 billion pound ($4.95 billion) offer to Names designed to offset the cost of Equitas, support among British Names for the plan has grown.</p>
<p>A last-ditch attempt at securing more favourable treatment by a British-based action group floundered last week when the High Court threw out a case for judicial review of the plan.</p>
<p>But in the United States, Lloyd's has for several years faced a raft of litigation. This latest challenge by 100 American Names contends that Lloyd's has breached U.S. disclosure laws.</p>
<p>The insurance market's chief executive, Ron Sandler, is fighting the action personally. He was cross-examined Monday.</p>
<p>Judge Robert Payne criticised the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for refusing to determine whether Lloyd's should be subject to U.S. securities laws.</p>
<p>The legal challenge was complicated on Friday by the SEC's neutral position on this issue. Payne said the SEC would have a second opportunity to respond to his request for a ruling.</p>
<p>Early Tuesday morning, however, Lloyd's received a boost from a separate court case in New York, which dismissed action brought against the market by four Names. They had claimed that Lloyd's knew long ago the extent of liabilities faced by Names.</p>
<p>&quot;We are pleased by this decision. Names entered into their commitments under UK law and we are pleased that U.S. courts continue to recognise this,&quot; said Lloyd's U.S. boss Peter Lane.</p>
<p>The market last week published guidelines for helping those Names who were worst off after accepting its recovery plan.</p>
