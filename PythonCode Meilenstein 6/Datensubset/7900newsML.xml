<p>Blue-chip shares closed broadly lower on Thursday at the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) in light trade affected by a local holiday, brokers said.</p>
<p>They said the market was directionless due to the absence of domestic funds and banks.</p>
<p>Foreign funds were selective participants, selling a few pivotals and buying other shares, the brokers said.</p>
<p>The 30-share BSE index closed 16.70 points, or 0.49 percent, lower at a provisional 3,389.52, after rising to 3,424.73.</p>
<p>The 50-stock NSE index gained 2.56 points at a provisional 1,001.56, off the day's high of 1,010.20.</p>
<p>The 500-share CRISIl index eased 1.41 points to a provisional 678.86.</p>
<p>One trader said foreign funds sold bank stock SBI, petrochemicals major Reliance and state-run telephone monopoly MTNL. The funds bought finance firm IDBI and engineering stock Larsen &amp; Toubro.</p>
<p>SBI fell 6.0 rupees to 267, Reliance 3.50 to 212.25 and MTNL 3.0 to 191.50. IDBI firmed 2.50 rupees to 117.50 but L&amp;T was down 2.50 at 245.</p>
<p>ACC shed 49.75 rupees to 2,102.75, TISCO 4.50 to 188.50 and Tata Power 3.25 to 149.75.</p>
<p>The chief of tobacco firm ITC said its British partner B.A.T Industries Plc plans to set up new company to sell new cigarette brands.</p>
<p>&quot;We'll have a stake in the new firm, We're still negotiating it,&quot; ITC chairman Yogi Deveshwar told reporters in Calcutta after firm's annual general meeting.</p>
<p>ITC slipped 5.25 rupees to 286.25.</p>
