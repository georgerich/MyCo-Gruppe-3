<p>Turkish shares rose by 1.47 percent on Wednesday amid selective demand and improved market mood, brokers said.</p>
<p>The IMKB-100  .ISEC stood at 64,302.67, up 932.98 points from Tuesday. Gains so far this week have totalled 3.12 percent.</p>
<p>Daily volume rose to 7.8 trillion lira ($90.7 million) from Tuesday's 5.0 trillion ($58.1 million)</p>
<p>&quot;The market can rise to 65,000 tomorrow but profit-taking sales may come after that,&quot; said Cenk Akyoldas from Yatirim Finansman.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the buying in state shares came in the afternoon because share prices are cheap and there was nothing to spoil market mood,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Brokers said buying in state-sector shares towards the end of the session had spilled over to the rest of the market, dragging the index higher.</p>
<p>They said there was still no fresh cash entry to the market in the lack of fresh expectations or market-moving news but they said cheaper prices after last week's 4.16 percent drop spurred selective activity. SA ERC</p>
