<p>The U.N. refugee agency said it ended on Thursday the repatriation from Burundi of more than 45,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees from the biggest camp in northern Burundi.</p>
<p>Paul Stromberg, spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) told Reuters by telephone from northern Burundi that the last 6,000 refugees were en route to Rwanda from Magara refugee camp, leaving behind only 220 who refused to go.</p>
<p>&quot;The last convoy left with about four trucks. The camp of Magara is now empty except for these 220 people. These people do not want to return home for one reason or another,&quot; Stromberg said.</p>
<p>Asked about what would happen to those who had refused to go back, Stromberg said: &quot;They are still refugees and will be treated as such. One option is to move them to another site and this can be done without government approval.&quot;</p>
<p>He said 6,000 Rwandan Hutus went back home on Thursday and a total of 50,000 refugees from Magara camp would have returned once the last convoy reached south Rwanda.</p>
<p>Refugees have accused Burundian troops of harassing them and say they decided to leave because they feared for their lives.</p>
<p>Groups of hardline Hutu refugees in Magara stoned troops of Burundi's Tutsi-dominated army last Sunday after refusing to take apart parts of the camp that had already been abandoned.</p>
<p>Troops later on Sunday shot dead three refugees as they tried to leave the camp. The military said its soldiers only opened fire after a refugee pulled out a handgun and started shooting.</p>
<p>Burundian army officers have accused the Rwandan Hutu refugees of backing Burundian Hutu rebels infiltrating Burundi.</p>
<p>The Rwandan refugee exodus from Burundi began after Burundi's army toppled Hutu president Sylvestre Ntibantunganya on July 25 and installed retired army major Pierre Buyoya.</p>
<p>Buyoya, who is trying to break down international opposition to the army coup, has pledged not to force Rwandan refugees in Burundi to return home and ordered a halt to forced expulsions by the Tutsi army earlier in July.</p>
<p>The return from camps in Burundi is the biggest movement back since some two million Rwandans, mostly Hutu refugees, fled to Burundi, Zaire and Tanzania during the 1994 killing of up to one million Tutsis and moderate Hutus by Hutu troops, militia and mobs.</p>
<p>In another development, the U.N. Human Rights Field Office for Rwanda said on Thursday that 271 Rwandan refugees returning from Burundi in July and August were arrested by Rwandan authorities.</p>
<p>In a report, it said 62 them had been released.</p>
<p>Rwandan authorities screen returning refugees and arrest any suspected of involvement in the 1994 genocide.</p>
<p>UNHCR officials say they plan to move the repatriation operation to the last Rwandan refugee camp in Burundi at Rukuramigabo, which has some 13,000 Rwandans.</p>
<p>There were some 135,000 Rwandan refugees in Burundi at the start of the year.</p>
