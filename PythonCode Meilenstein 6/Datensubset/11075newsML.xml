<dateline>BELGRADE 1996-08-23</dateline>

<p>The restoration of relations between rump Yugoslavia (FRY), comprising Serbia and Montenegro, and Croatia ends five years of crisis following the disintegration of the former Yugoslav federation.</p>
<p>Here is the chronology of events that first destroyed the multinational union of former Yugoslavia, and later helped the two neighbours normalise relations after a seven-month war between rebel Serbs and Croatian government forces.</p>
<p>May 4, 1980 - Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito dies, signalling the beginning of the Communist Party's decline and opening the way for the rise of nationalism and disintegration of the country.</p>
<p>June 28, 1989 - Serbian Communist Party leader Slobodan Milosevic addresses Serbs at Kosovo Polje on 600th anniversary of defeat of medieval Serb kingdom by Turks. The speech helped launch a revival of Serbian nationalism, raising tensions between the six Yugoslav republics.</p>
<p>1991</p>
<p>March 31 - First armed incident between Croatia and rebel Serbs opposed to independence from Yugoslavia takes place in Titova Korenica near Plitvice.</p>
<p>June 25 - Slovenia and Croatia proclaim formal independence from Yugoslav federation.</p>
<p>June 27 - The Yugoslav federal army (JNA) starts withdrawing from Slovenia and Croatia, but fighting begins between Croats and local Serbs helped by JNA. Croatian Serbs announce self-styled republic of Serb Krajina.</p>
<p>October 1 - JNA launches attack on the Adriatic port of Dubrovnik and soon begins shelling the ancient walled city and well-known tourist destination. The siege, which lacks any clear military rationale, draws international outrage and the JNA withdraws in 1992.</p>
<p>November 18 - Serbs backed by JNA tanks and artillery capture the eastern town of Vukovar after brutal siege which levels the town in ex-Yugoslavia's most devastating battle.</p>
<p>1992</p>
<p>January 15 - A truce ends seven months of fighting between rebel Serbs and Croats, with Serbs holding roughly a third of the territory. U.N. peacekeeping troops deploy to police ceasefire.</p>
<p>Aug 8 - Representatives of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY), now consisting only of Serbia and Montenegro, meet in Budapest to sign agreement on prisoner of war exchanges.</p>
<p>Oct 20 - Yugoslavia and Croatia sign declaration in Geneva on opening of missions in Belgrade and Zagreb, restoration of roads, railways, telecommunication links, pensions.</p>
<p>1993</p>
<p>Sept 21 - Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic and Tudjman meet on British warship HMS Invincible in Adriatic Sea. Milosevic says agreement reached on almost all questions regarding Bosnia.</p>
<p>1994</p>
<p>Nov 4, Zagreb - Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic meets FRY counterpart Vladislav Jovanovic. Two rounds of talks fail due to disputes over the future status of the Serb region of Krajina.</p>
<p>1995</p>
<p>Jan 31 - Rebel Croatian Serbs reject an international peace plan giving them autonomy under Zagreb government rule.</p>
<p>May 1 - Croatian army moves to recapture Serb-held Western Slavonia, one of three enclaves under Serb control.</p>
<p>May 2 - Rebel Serbs retaliate by firing missiles on Zagreb city centre.</p>
<p>Aug 4 - Croatian army launches &quot;Operation Storm&quot; to recapture Serb Krajina region which falls within hours. Some 200,000 Serbs flee their homes in the Krajina in the largest exodus of the Yugoslav conflict. Only Eastern Slavonia region remains in Serb hands.</p>
<p>Nov 2 - U.S.-organised peace talks to end fighting in Bosnia begin in Dayton, Ohio.</p>
<p>Nov 12 - Croatian Serbs end four-year revolt signing an accord to handover Eastern Slavonia to Croatia after a transitional period under U.N. authority. Milosevic and Tudjman agree accord on the fringes of the Dayton talks.</p>
<p>Nov 21 - Presidents Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia, Franjo Tudjman of Croatia and Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia sign Bosnia peace agreement in Dayton.</p>
<p>Dec 21 - Zagreb-Belgrade telephone links restored - first to talk are Croatian foreign minister Mate Granic and Yugoslav counterpart Milan Milutinovic.</p>
<p>1996</p>
<p>June 24 - FRY, Croatia agree to open consular offices in their capitals.</p>
<p>Aug 7 - Milosevic and Tudjman meet in Athens and announce plans to sign mutual recognition accord in two weeks. The two leaders, widely blamed for igniting the Yugoslav wars, have met a total of 48 times since 1991.</p>
