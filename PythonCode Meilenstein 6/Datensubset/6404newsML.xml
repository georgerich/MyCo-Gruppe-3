<p>Plains feedlot cattle markets Wednesday were slow, compared with Tuesday when prices rallied $2.00 per cwt to $68.00 in heavy trading, feedlot sources said.</p>
<p>Light sales were reported at $68.00 as packers finished picking through the nearly depleted showlists, even requesting some feedlots hold cattle a few extra days before transport to plants, the sources said.</p>
<p>About 3,000 head were reported sold in the Texas Panhandle/western Oklahoma area and about 6,000 in Kansas, cattle feeders in the respective areas said.  </p>
<p>Prices were expected to remain strong, with some sources predicting $70.00 by the first week of September, or possibly as early as next week.</p>
<p>Feedlot prices were bolstered by tightening supplies of market-ready cattle, which were expected to be whittled each of the next four weeks as a result of light placements during April and May, sources said.</p>
<p>A few cattle feeders suggested that nearly half of next week's showlists had already been committed as packers aggressively tried to secure inventories going into the Labor Day holiday week.</p>
