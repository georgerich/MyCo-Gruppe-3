<title>UK: NWE fuel oil retains strength, no sign of weakness.</title>
<headline>NWE fuel oil retains strength, no sign of weakness.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-08-23</dateline>

<p>Fuel oil in NWE continued its week long rally on Friday backed by tight avails and firm crude.</p>
<p>High sulphur cracked fuel oil barges jumped again, trading at $100, $101 and $102 fob ARA with one buyer responsible for nearly all the activity.</p>
<p>Brokers were cautious about how much the rise was based on fundamental given that bunker demand was again thin, and some suggest the buyer was trying to hike the market in anticipation of pricing a cargo. But, others said support was coming from a very tight cargo market. One trader was understood to be looking at the barge market in order to make up a cargo.</p>
<p>The cargo market itself was stronger. A trader was heard bidding in the high $90s fob NWE in a very tight market. No trade was done and brokers thought prices were unlikely to lose ground until more cargoes become available.</p>
<p>The low sulphur cracked market also gained from crude and the need for three very prompt cargoes of low and medium sulphur product into Lebanaon. Dealers said in excess of $112 cif Med would probably have to be paid. Also giving backing to the higher prices were traders looking for low sulphur material to blend with high sulphur to meet demand from a Med end user for two percent sulphur. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 8980</p>
