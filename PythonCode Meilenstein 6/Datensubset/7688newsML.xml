<headline>Murdoch's News Corp forecasts alien-led profit boost.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY, Australia</dateline>
<text>
<p>Media baron Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. Ltd. on Thursday announced a lower than expected profit for the last fiscal year, but forecast a 20 percent jump in profit this year, partly due to the hit alien-movie Independence Day.</p>
<p>&quot;A budgeted profit increase of at least 20 percent for the full year currently appears very attainable,&quot; News Corp. said in announcing its 1995/96 full year results.</p>
<p>&quot;From an earnings perspective, the current fiscal year has begun with great promise due to the hit motion picture Independence Day, a moderating trend in paper prices and a solid forward book of advertising at the Fox Broadcasting Company, which will broadcast both the World Series and Super Bowl,&quot; News Corp. said in a statement.</p>
<p>In reporting its results for the year ended June 30, 1996, Fox said that after tax, but before unusual items, profit had dipped 6 percent to A$1.26 billion ($995 million).</p>
<p>Analysts had on average expected A$1.34 billion ($1.05 billion).</p>
<p>Total operating profits declined slightly to A$1.59 billion ($1.26 billion) from A$1.66 billion ($1.31 billion), as strong performances in U.S. television and British newspapers were offset by lower results from News' magazine, book and Asian Star TV operations.</p>
<p>Solid earnings growth at Britain's BSkyB television operations and Australian Newsprint Mills were also offset by lower results from airline Ansett Australia and Australian publisher Queensland Press.</p>
<p>News Corp. said Australian newspaper results remained virtually flat, with higher newsprint prices increasing group costs by over $300 million.</p>
<p>News Corp. also reported an abnormal loss of A$243 million ($192 million) primarily due to losses associated with the sale of U.S. book publisher HarperCollins' Scott Foresman and College divisions.</p>
