<p>European vegetable oil prices followed the lower Chicago opening on Thursday despite news of Chinese approval of a palm oil import quota, traders said.</p>
<p>Malaysian Primary Industries Minister Lim Keng Yaik said China had approved imports of 1.3 million tonnes of palm oil between August 1996 and March 1997.</p>
<p>Lim said he believed 80 percent of palm oil would come from Malaysia with Indonesia making up the balance.</p>
<p>Malaysia's Bernama news agency quoted the minister as saying that he had received the news two day's ago.</p>
<p>&quot;On the face of it the news should be bullish, but people have had an idea this was coming and to some extent it is already in the market,&quot; said a trader.</p>
<p>Traders said it was doubtful that the news would lead to any immediate buying from China.</p>
<p>&quot;Prices are a little on the high side for the Chinese at present so we won't see them just yet,&quot; said one.</p>
<p>Crude palm oil cif Europe closed $5.00 up to unchanged after Sep traded at $512.50 a tonne.</p>
<p>Products close around $2.50 down with no further business reorted.</p>
<p>Coconut oil attracted some dealer trading with Jul/Aug trading at $780, Aug/Sep at $760, $757.50 and $755, Sep/Oct at $735 and Oct/Nov $725 a tonne cif.</p>
<p>Coconut oil sellers closed $2.50 up to $5.00 down while palmkernel oil finished unchanged to $5.00 lower.</p>
<p>Soft oils shed 0.50 guilders following the lower Chicago opening with only one trade reported when Dutch soy oil fetched 94.50 guilders for Oct a 100 kilos fob ex-mill.</p>
