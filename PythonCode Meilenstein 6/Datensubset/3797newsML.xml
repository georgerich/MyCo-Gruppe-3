<p>Susan McDougal, a former business partner of President Bill Clinton, was sentenced on Tuesday to two years in prison for her fraud convictions in the Whitewater trial.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge George Howard handed down three 24-month prison terms which will run concurrently and an additional three years probation on another charge.  </p>
<p>McDougal was convicted in May on four charges relating to a fraudulent $300,000 business loan she was given in 1986. Prosecutors alleged that Clinton pressured an Arkansas banker to give McDougal that loan, but the president denied under oath any involvement in the deal.</p>
<p>Susan McDougal is the former wife of Arkansas businessman James McDougal. They were business partners with the president and first lady Hilary Rodham Clinton in the failed Whitewater real estate venture which lies at the heart of an independent investigation into Clinton's personal and political finances.</p>
<p>Apart from the prison sentence, Susan McDougal was also ordered to pay restitution of $300,000 plus interest to the U.S. Small Business Adminstration, which had insured the illegal loan.</p>
<p>James McDougal was to have been sentenced on Monday but won a temporary reprieve because he is cooperating with the team of independent counsel Kenneth Starr.</p>
