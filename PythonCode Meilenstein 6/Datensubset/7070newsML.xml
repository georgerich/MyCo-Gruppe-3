<p>Commercial bank Nordbanken, one of three Swedish financial institutions reporting half-yearly results on Wednesday, posted 18 percent profit growth and an end to the credit losses that have plagued it for years.</p>
<p>The state-controlled retail bank showed an operating profit of 3.8 billion crowns ($576 million) for the first half of the year, a healthy improvement on the 3.21 billion crowns recorded in the same 1995 period.</p>
<p>Credit losses fell to 260 million crowns from 661 million last year. Much of this improvement was due to the exploitation of a loan loss provision totalling 300 million crowns.</p>
<p>However, even without this provision, credit losses would have totalled no more than 0.49 percent of total lending, a level which signals that Nordbanken -- along with other Swedish banks -- has normalised loan loss levels at around 0.5 percent.</p>
<p>Even so, the improvement in earnings was by no means only the result of lower credit losses. A steady decline in market interest rates over the period had boosted profitability, Nordbanken said.</p>
<p>Debt yields in Sweden have fallen hardest at the short end of the market, while the rise in yields over the long term -- a steepening yield curve -- has allowed banks to cover long lending with cheaper borrowing in short-dated paper.</p>
<p>Lower rates also led to strong gains in the bank's bond portfolio, Nordbanken said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;The general downturn in rates influenced developments positively mainly through higher bond prices. Advantageous positioning (in the market) led to a strong improvement in the result from financial transactions,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>This item improved to 632 million crowns from just 45 million crowns in the first half of last year.</p>
<p>The bank also noted improvements on the cost side. Although personnel costs increased to 1.43 billion crowns from 1.38 billion last year, a fall in other operating costs meant a six percent decline in total expenses to 3.58 billion crowns.</p>
<p>Since the credit crash of the early 1990s which brought many Swedish banks cap-in-hand to the finance ministry for help, the industry has recovered with a vengeance.</p>
<p>Nordbanken's huge portfolio of bad debt and non-performing loans was hived off in a government rescue package, and the bank's highly profitable core operations have now come back into their own.</p>
<p>Nordbanken's profit after tax of 2.68 billion crowns for the first half means a return on equity of a solid 28 percent, and even discounting the result of financial transactions the return was 21 percent.</p>
<p>Smaller rival Foreningsbanken -- Sweden's traditional farmers' bank -- told a similar story, posting a 24 percent rise in operating profits for the first half to 524 million crowns.</p>
<p>Without the benefit of state subsidies, Foreningsbanken has had to bear a proportionally higher burden of loan losses than Nordbanken, although this item has now declined to a manageable 500 million crowns from 723 million last year.</p>
<p>More worrying was a decline in total income to 2.46 billion crowns from 2.53 billion last year, something the bank ascribed to a squeeze on margins from lower interest rates.</p>
<p>Mortgage institute Stadshypotek, in which the state has a 34 percent holding, reported a nine percent improvement in profit after credit losses to 1.55 billion crowns, with loan losses falling to 335 million crowns from 592 million.</p>
<p>Although Stadshypotek specialises in housing loans, the group's newly-started banking arm reported an increase in customer deposits to 3.3 billion crowns from 600 million.</p>
