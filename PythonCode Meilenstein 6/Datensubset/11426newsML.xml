<p>Georgia's unemployment rate dipped to 4.9 percent in July from 5.0 percent in June and 5.5 percent a year ago, state Labor Commissioner David Poythress said Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;We expected the rate to drop somewhat in July because it went up from May to June, when students and other secondary wage earners began to look for summer work, and they found work in July,&quot; Poythress said.</p>
<p>&quot;While some people got Olympic-related jobs, others found work in grocery stores, retail outlets, recreational centers and amusement parks. Even though the Olympic Games are over, we don't expect to see a significant rise in the unemployment rate,&quot; Poythress said.</p>
<p>Many Olympic workers were volunteers while others work for temporary employment agencies that have said they planned to continuing employing most workers hired for the Games, the labor commissioner said.</p>
<p>For the metropolitan Atlanta area, the July jobless rate declined to 3.8 percent, down from four percent in June and 4.8 percent a year ago.</p>
<p>Albany had the state's highest unemployment rate in July, 6.7 percent, while Athens had the lowest, 3.4 percent.</p>
<p>Poythress said the state's unemployment rate had stayed below five percent, the level many economists consider to be full employment, for the past year. The state added 170,100 new jobs over the year.</p>
