<p>Vietnam sentenced a prominent dissident to two years' jail on Thursday and imposed suspended sentences on two others, court sources said.</p>
<p>Le Hong Ha, a former high-ranking party member, was sentenced to two years in prison. Ha Si Phu, a leading academic and outspoken communist Nguyen Kien Giang, were given suspended sentences of a year and 15 months respectively.  </p>
<p>The sources said all three men had been accused of divulging state secrets. Foreign correspondents were not allowed to attend the trial and further details were not immediately available.</p>
<p>Le Hong Ha and Ha Si Phu were arrested late last year during a broader crackdown on dissent in the run-up to Vietnam's Eighth Communist Party Congress.</p>
<p>Nguyen Kien Giang was investigated for possessing state secrets a few weeks later, but had not been taken into custody.</p>
<p>It had not been clear in advance of Thursday's trial whether he would be sentenced alongside Ha and Phu.</p>
