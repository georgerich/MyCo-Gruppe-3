<p>Naphtha prices slipped on Wednesday in a quiet market where cautious traders were sidelined waiting for the opening of overseas crude markets for some clue of market direction.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the (overseas) crude drop has made people a little bit nervous,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;But, I still think there will be more selling than buying,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>First-half October open-spec naphtha was assessed bid at $195 and offered at $196. Second-half October was assessed bid and offered at $193.75/195.0.  </p>
<p>First-half November was notionally assessed bid around $193.0 to $193.25 and offered at around $194.0 to $194.25.</p>
<p>A second-half October was traded overnight at $195.5, while a first-half October was rumoured done at $196.</p>
<p>Naphtha end-users have mostly covered their requirements for September, traders said.</p>
<p>They now appear to have shifted their attention to their requirements for October, which would include their needs to meet winter demand for heating fuel. traders said.</p>
