<p>An 11-year-old Albanian boy is suspected of biting a sleeping baby to death, the state-run news agency ATA reported on Thursday.</p>
<p>The five-month-old baby boy, who bled to death, was found with savage teeth marks on his neck and body. Police suspected the older boy, dubbed &quot;the vampire&quot; by the local press, of being responsible because he had a record of biting other people.</p>
<p>An investigation using measurements and photographs indicated the boy carried out the attack, ATA said. Police also found blood-soaked clothes belonging to the boy and were holding them as evidence, it added.</p>
<p>The agency said the boy, who could not be arrested because his age, remained at home in the western village of Jube and was behaving extremely aggressively. &quot;Policemen handed him a notebook...and he ate it,&quot; it said.</p>
