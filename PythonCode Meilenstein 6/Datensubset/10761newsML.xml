<p>U.S. stocks ended modestly lower as a surprisingly strong July durable goods report sent the long bond skidding and its yield soaring to the highest level in three weeks.</p>
<p>&quot;Given the fact that bonds plummeted the stock market didn't act too badly. We had a respectable session on very low volume,&quot; said Hildegard Zagorski, a Prudential Securities market analyst.</p>
<p>The Dow industrials lost 11 to about 5723. For the week, the Dow rose about 33 points.  </p>
<p>The long bond slumped 1-3/32, boosting its yield to 6.93 percent -- the highest since July 31.</p>
<p>Bonds were sent reeling by news that July durable goods orders rose 1.6 percent, against expectations for a 0.3 percent advance. Ex-defense durable goods orders climbed 3.5 percent, compared with expectations for a 0.8 percent rise. June durables were revised up to a 0.2 percent drop from the previously reported 0.6 percent fall.</p>
<p>Bond players said the data, coupled with expectations that job growth jumped in August may reignite talk of a Fed tightening.  </p>
<p>The recently favored interest-rate sensitive financial sector met some brisk selling. Freddie Mac lost 1-7/8 to 90-1/8, Fannie Mae lost 1/2 to 32-1/2, Citicorp was off 7/8 to 86-7/8 and Dow component J.P. Morgan was off 1-1/8 to 91-3/8.</p>
<p>Analysts said the broader market was resilient in the face of stiff bond selling.</p>
<p>&quot;If rates can stay beneath seven percent, the market will survive this mess. Anything above seven percent is a real psychological negative and bonds once again become a viable alternative for money,&quot; said Ralph Bloch, chief technical analyst at Raymond James.  </p>
<p>The tech-studded Nasdaq Composite slipped one to about 1143 after Thursday's 17-point surge.  Losers outpaced gainers 4-3 on quiet NYSE volume of about 307 million shares.</p>
<p>A resumption of more normal trading activity is expected after the September 2 U.S. Labor Day holiday when more players, who delayed earlier summer vacations, return.</p>
<p>&quot;We had a very vigorous summer session and a lot of people hadn't taken vacation until now. A lot of people delayed vacation. The (IPO) calendar in June and July was outrageous. You had to strike while the iron's hot,&quot; said Brett Discher, a vice president of equity trading at Dain Bosworth.  </p>
<p>The Dow's afternoon recovery from session lows was aided by a turnaround in Philip Morris shares, up 1-1/8 to 88.</p>
<p>The steadiness in tobacco shares came as President Clinton detailed new rules to curb teen smoking by restricting sales and marketing of tobacco. It was the first time tobacco had been subjected to Food and Drug Administration regulation.</p>
<p>Wall Street was also awaiting the outcome of a key tobacco liability case in Indiana. The jury started deliberations Thursday. Among tobacco shares, RJR Nabisco, parent of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, rose 1/8 to 25-3/8, Loews slipped 3/8 to 74-3/4, and smokeless tobacco maker UST fell 1/4 to 30-1/2.  </p>
<p>&quot;Selling in tobacco shares wafted away,&quot; said Marty Kearney, a trader at PTI SEcurities.</p>
<p>&quot;Morris might raise its dividend next week. It's a 4.6 percent yield now, and the yield could be 5.5 percent. There's some bargain-hunting, but it might be early,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Paper and forest products stocks firmed after Goldman Sachs started coverage of the sector with overweight. Georgia-Pacific, up 1-3/4 to 77-7/8, and Willamette, up 1-3/8 to 65, were added to Goldman's recommended list. Boise Cascade, rated a Goldman trading buy, rose 5/8 to 35.  </p>
<p>Among individual stocks, Bay Networks rose 1-7/8 to 27-1/8 and was the most-active NYSE issue amid renewed speculation of a possible buyout by Lucent Technologies. Both companies declined comment.</p>
<p>C-Cube climbed 3-3/8 to 33-3/4 on hopes that the maker of semiconductor-based encoders might get some of Zenith Electronics' $1 billion contract for supplying digital TV set-top boxes to the Americast consortium, analysts said.</p>
<p>Zenith, which climbed 5-1/2 Thursday on news of the Americast deal, gave back two to 14-7/8.  </p>
<p>The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.91 to 1143.05.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 index fell 3.65 to 667.03.</p>
