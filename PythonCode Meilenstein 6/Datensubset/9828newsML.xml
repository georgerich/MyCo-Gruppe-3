<p>Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Mother Teresa, under treatment at an Indian nursing home for fever and cardiac problems, is resting and not in critical condition, a doctor said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;She is resting at present,&quot; Dr A.K. Bardhan told Reuters in the eastern city of Calcutta. &quot;She is not in critical condition.&quot;</p>
<p>Bardhan said the 85-year-old Roman Catholic missionary was admitted to the Woodlands Nursing Home in Calcutta on Tuesday night with fever and &quot;rigor&quot;, or chills accompanied by contraction of the skin.</p>
<p>She was admitted to the intensive care unit on Wednesday evening after developing a cardiac problem, and put on an artificial respirator, the attending physician said.</p>
<p>Bardhan said Mother Teresa remained in the intensive care unit on Thursday morning. He did not elaborate on her exact condition.</p>
<p>&quot;We are all praying for her speedy recovery,&quot; said a nun at Mother Teresa's Roman Catholic religious order, the Missionaries of Charity in Calcutta.</p>
<p>The nun, who asked not to be identified, said all of the order's senior nuns were at the nursing home attending Mother Teresa, who will be 86 on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The health of the woman, who founded a network of missions for the poor and the sick in India's most densely populated city and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979, began to deteriorate in 1989 when she was fitted with a heart pacemaker.</p>
<p>In 1991, Mother Teresa was treated at a California hospital for heart disease and bacterial pneumonia.</p>
<p>In May 1993, she fell in Rome and broke three ribs. In August the same year, while in New Delhi to receive yet another award, she developed malaria, complicated by her heart and lung problems.</p>
<p>The wrinkled nun of Albanian descent regarded by many as a living saint founded the Missionaries of Charity in Calcutta in 1949. The religious order now has nearly 3,000 people ministering to the needy, dying and orphaned in the slums of 200 cities.</p>
<p>The work includes the care of nearly 7,000 children in 120 homes and arranging 1,500 adoptions each year. In 1988, nearly four million sick people were treated at her 629 mobile clinics.</p>
