<title>NETHERLANDS: Dutch closing debt market report.</title>

<p>Dutch bonds lost all of the previous day's gains as they finished weaker on Friday with the long end of the yield curve bearing the brunt of the sell-off.</p>
<p>Dealers said guilder bonds started higher but the direction was swiftly reversed as bund futures failed to breach important resistance around 98.00.</p>
<p>&quot;The longer end has come under a tiny bit of pressure,&quot; said a dealer, who sees Dutch bonds continuing their falls next week.</p>
<p>He said that with yield discounts to bunds in the 2003-2004 maturity range at nine to 12 basis points, Dutch bonds were overpriced against German equivalents.  </p>
<p>Another dealer said volumes remained low, a situation not helped by the approaching weekend and British bank holiday on Monday.</p>
<p>But dealers reported good offshore buying in the 1999 and 2000 maturities, cushioning the effect of the sell-off w33n in the rest of the yield curve.</p>
<p>&quot;They're (buyers) still expecting the short end to go lower,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>They said a stronger than expected rise in U.S. durable goods orders in July did not help market sentiment.</p>
