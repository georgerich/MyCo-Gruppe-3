<p>Investors drove British share prices to their third record close this week on Friday after overcoming jitters from unexpectedly strong U.S. sales data.</p>
<p>London's blue-chip FTSE 100 index closed 16 points higher at 3,907.5, just short of its trading peak of 3,911 struck early in the day.</p>
<p>German and French shares ended mixed, while the dollar lost ground against the mark after its push higher sparked by a German rate cut on Thursday fizzled out.</p>
<p>Wall Street's strong overnight performance had been a major influence on London shares early on, along with hopes the move by the German Bundesbank could pave the way for British rates to be shaved again, too.</p>
<p>Strong U.S. durable goods figures weighed heavily on Wall Street and briefly hurt European share prices. By the close of European business, the Dow was still showing losses of 18 points.</p>
<p>The dollar's fall below 1.49 marks in Europe followed a fresh look at the likely direction of interest rates following the Bundesbank's decision to cut its money market repo rate.</p>
<p>&quot;The sentiment is that this will be the last German cut, which has left a bit of a vacuum today as people decide which way to position themselves,&quot; one German bank dealer said.</p>
<p>By the end of European trade, the dollar remained stuck at 1.4851 marks and 108.51 yen, compared with 1.4935 and 108.43 at the London close on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;The dollar had a perfect opportunity to go up after the repo cut but it couldn't break through the congestion from the last few weeks,&quot; said Alan Collins, head of technical analysis at Merita Bank.</p>
<p>London share traders said they expected the market to consolidate its recent gains although the underlying tone remained firm and the next big target is 4,000 points.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not that far away but I would be moderately surprised to see 4,000 in the ultra short term. The market has rallied very quickly from the sell-off in the early part of July when Wall Street was under pressure,&quot; said UBS strategist Tim Brown.</p>
<p>French shares ended slightly higher after spending most of the day adrift on profit-taking following a big rise on Thursday. The CAC-40 index closed up 3.06 points at 2,020.82.</p>
<p>&quot;There are still too many uncertainties to really start buying French shares,&quot; a dealer said, noting upcoming budget talks and threatened social unrest in September.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Alain Juppe is due to meet President Jacques Chirac this weekend to hammer out budget and tax cut details.</p>
<p>German equities ended a dull bourse session almost unchanged from closing levels on Thursday as the weaker dollar and softer bonds weighed on sentiment.</p>
<p>Chemical shares were among the main winners in the bourse session. BASF ended up 47 pfennigs at 43.60 marks after reporting a 14.7 percent rise in first-half profits on Thursday.</p>

<p>The dollar remained stuck at 1.4851 marks and 108.51 yen, compared with 1.4935 and 108.43 at the London close on Thursday.</p>
