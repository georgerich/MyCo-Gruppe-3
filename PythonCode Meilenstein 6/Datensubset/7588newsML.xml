<headline>China summons Ukraine ambassador in row over Taiwan.</headline>
<dateline>BEIJING 1996-08-22</dateline>

<p>China has summoned Ukraine's ambassador in Beijing Anatoly Plyushko to lodge a protest over a visit to Kiev by Taiwan's Vice President Lien Chan, an embassy spokesman said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;The Chinese expressed displeasure over this action in Ukraine that this person from Taiwan has got permission to visit the country,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Chinese State Councillor Li Tieying, a member of the powerful Politburo of the ruling Communist Party, has also postponed a visit to Ukraine, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Beijing has regarded Taiwan as a rebel province since the end of a civil war in 1949 and has sought to push the island into diplomatic isolation. The former Soviet republic of Ukraine recognises China and not Taiwan.</p>
<p>Taiwan's state radio reported that Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma met Lien on Wednesday, but a spokesman for Kuchma and the embassy spokesman denied this.</p>
<p>&quot;No official in Ukraine ever met Lien Chan. No official even intended to,&quot; the embassy spokesman said.</p>
<p>&quot;The actions were done by private firms and institutions. It was a private voyage,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Lien surfaced in Kiev on Tuesday, two days after vanishing on a mysterious European mission. He made a secret detour to Ukraine after making a state visit to the Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>Taiwan state television showed Lien with his wife and other Taiwan and Ukraine officials posing at the University of Kiev, where the announcer said Lien had received an honorary degree.</p>
<p>Lien and Kuchma signed an agreement on Wedneday to exchange representative offices, Taiwan newspapers said on Thursday.</p>
