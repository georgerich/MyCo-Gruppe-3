<p>The chief aide to Economy Minister Roque Fernandez said Wednesday delays in Congress of a new budget package meant it would not meet its aim of reducing Argentina's deficit by $1.2 billion by year-end.</p>
<p>After Peronist congressmen said the package could not be passed until early October, Fernandez's top advisor Carlos Rodriguez told reporters this would mean its benefits would be felt over only two months instead of four.  </p>
<p>&quot;If it was calculated on four months, and now there are only two, then it's obvious, it's a matter of algebra,&quot; said Rodriguez. &quot;What makes it worse is that if the (new) fuel tax is voted in October it only takes effect from November.&quot;</p>
<p>Fernandez sent his package of new taxes and tax exemption cuts to Congress Wednesday and goes there to explain them to lawmakers Thursday. They are designed to reduce a budget gap which hit $2.5 billion by mid-year and which Fernandez warns would be $6.6 billion by year-end without his austerity moves.</p>
<p>However Rodriguez played down the impact of any such delay on confidence in Argentina's commitment to fiscal solvency.</p>
<p>&quot;If the package is approved by Congress and markets see they are going to be approved and society will execute those measures, then I believe it's not so important than we lose a little money,&quot; said the official.</p>
<p>Argentina had agreed with the International Monetary Fund on a $2.5 billion deficit for the whole year. An IMF mission arrived in Buenos Aires Tuesday to renegotiate those targets.</p>
<p>Some analysts fear the measures will be watered down in Congress because of the reluctance of lawmakers from the ruling Peronist Party to approve more unpopular moves after benefit cuts by Fernandez's predecessor Domingo Cavallo. They sparked one general strike and unions are threatening another.</p>
<p>Local newspapers said the package went to Congress a day late due to last minute revisions -- said to include scrapping plans to raise women's retirement age to 65 from 60 and to reduce value-added tax to 20 percent from 21 percent from January 1.</p>
