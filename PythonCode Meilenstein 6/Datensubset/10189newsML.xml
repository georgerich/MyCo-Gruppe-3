<title>UK: British shrug off U.S. data to hit new peak.</title>
<headline>British shrug off U.S. data to hit new peak.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON</dateline>
<text>
<p>Investors drove British stock prices to the third record close this week on Friday after overcoming jitters from unexpectedly strong U.S. sales data.</p>
<p>London's blue-chip FTSE 100 index closed 16.4 points higher at 3,907.5, just short of its trading peak of 3,911 struck early in the day.</p>
<p>Wall Street's strong overnight performance had been a major influence on London shares early on, along with hopes that Thursday's rate cut by the German Bundesbank could pave the way for British rates to be shaved again, too.</p>
<p>Strong U.S. durable goods figures weighed heavily on Wall Street and briefly hurt European share prices.</p>
<p>London share traders said they expected the market to consolidate its recent gains although the underlying tone remained firm and the next big target is 4,000 points.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not that far away but I would be moderately surprised to see 4,000 in the ultra short term. The market has rallied very quickly from the sell-off in the early part of July when Wall Street was under pressure,&quot; said UBS strategist Tim Brown.</p>
