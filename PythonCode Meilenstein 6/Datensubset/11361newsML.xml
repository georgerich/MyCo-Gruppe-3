<p>The sales tax referendum proposed by Florida's Hillsborough County is deceptively worded and would unconstitutionally use public money to benefit a private, for-profit football team, Former Tampa Mayor William Poe told a judge Friday.</p>
<p>Poe filed a lawsuit against Hillsborough County Elections Supervisor Pam Iorio on Aug 19 seeking to remove the proposed half-cent sales tax increase from the Sept 3 ballot.</p>
<p>Hillsborough County Circuit Court Judge James Whittmore heard testimony Friday and said he would rule on Monday at the earliest.</p>
<p>If approved, the sales tax increase would raise $2.7 billion over 30 years, with 12 percent of that revenue used to pay debt service on a $168 million stadium for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The rest of the money would fund schools, roads, libraries and public safety projects.</p>
<p>Poe's attorney, Thomas Morrison, said Hillsborough County Commissioners had created &quot;a wish list of projects with the stadium buried in it so the voters will buy it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The commissioners felt a stand alone stadium tax would not fly,&quot; Morrison said.</p>
<p>He said the tax was proposed mainly to benefit Bucs owner Malcolm Glazer and his family, who had threatened to move the team away from Tampa because unless the county built a new stadium that increased their profits. He said the ballot language does not adequately make clear the purpose of the tax, as required by state law.</p>
<p>Hillsborough County's attorney, Emeline Acton, said the stadium was a community project because it would also be used by the Tampa Bay Mutiny soccer club, the new University of South Florida football team and would house other events.</p>
<p>Acton said the Florida Constitution allows public money to be used to enhance private development in serving the public interest.</p>
<p>&quot;The pairing of public and private revenue more and more is the only way governments can make things happen,&quot; Acton said.</p>
<p>She said the stadium proposal had received so much media attention that to claim voters would not know what they were voting on was &quot;like saying the people of Los Angeles are not aware of the O.J. trial.&quot;</p>
<p>Under an agreement between the city of Tampa and Hillsborough County, the Bucs' stadium would be financed with revenue bonds issued by the Tampa Sports Authority and repaid from stadium and sales tax revenues.</p>
