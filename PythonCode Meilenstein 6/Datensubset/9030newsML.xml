<p>The Canadian dollar ended stronger on Thursday after the Bank of Canada cut short-term interest rates, perhaps for the last time in this cycle.</p>
<p>Canada's central bank eased its key bank rate by 25 basis points to 4.25 percent after Germany's Bundesbank chopped short-term rates. The Bank of Canada released a statement which the market saw as a signal it will not lower rates further, said CIBC foreign exchange specialist Reid Farrill.</p>
<p>The Bank of Canada said the cumulative interest rate moves -- seven this year -- are &quot;substantial&quot; and can be expected to help the economy over the next year.  </p>
<p>&quot;Much of the market is surprised the dollar would strengthen on the day we have a rate cut,&quot; Farrill said. However, many investors who had parked their funds in U.S. currency rushed back to buy the Canadian dollar after the rate cut, he added.</p>
<p>In economic news, Statistics Canada reported stronger than expected retail sales for June, but said early signs pointed to a drop in July sales. Retail sales rose 0.6 percent to C$17.97 billion from C$17.86 billion in May.</p>
<p>The overnight range is from C$1.3650 to C$1.3710, Farrill said.  </p>
<p>On the crosses, the Canada dollar rose to 1.0900 marks from Wednesday's close of 1.0784 marks and gained to 79.07 yen from roughly 78.89 yen.</p>
