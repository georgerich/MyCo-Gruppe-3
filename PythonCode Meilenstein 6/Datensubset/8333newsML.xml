<p>Hundreds of grief-stricken Belgians arrived on Thursday for the funeral of two eight-year- old children starved to death by a paedophile gang which abducted at least four other girls.</p>
<p>The national outpouring of grief since the bodies of Melissa Russo and Julie Lejeune were unearthed last weekend revived memories of the display of mourning after the death of Belgium's much-loved King Baudouin three years ago.</p>
<p>The government has called for one minute's silence at 11 a.m (0900 GMT) on Thursday, the start of the memorial service which will be televised live.</p>
<p>Of the 100,000 people expected to attend the service in Liege's Saint Martin basilica, only about 1,000 can be accommodated inside. The others will be able to follow the mass on a large outside video screen.</p>
<p>After the service the two white coffins with the bodies of the two close friends will be buried privately.</p>
<p>Hundreds of people, arriving from all over the country with floral tributes, already lined the streets to the basilica down which the cortege will pass.</p>
<p>Giant bouquets in pastel shades stood at the entrance of Saint Martin's. There were wreaths from the Belgian government and King Albert and Queen Paola.</p>
<p>Cars carried black ribbons or banners, flags with black ribbons were flown from houses, and some bars displayed a picture of the dead girls next to a lit candle.</p>
<p>Support for the parents of Lejeune and Russo reflects the national, and international, campaign mounted to find them after their abduction in June 1995.</p>
<p>In a letter to the parents on an all-black frontpage below pictures of the girls and the words &quot;Our Children&quot;, popular daily La Derniere Heure praised the parents for their dignity in the face of the pain from the loss of their loved ones.</p>
<p>Popular newspaper Vers L'Avenir's frontpage was blank but for two large photos of the girls and the words &quot;Au Revoir&quot;.</p>
<p>Belgium has been in a state of shock since the weekend when convicted child rapist Marc Dutroux, 39 and unemployed, led police to the girls' bodies in the garden of a house he owned.</p>
<p>Two other girls held by him had been rescued earlier.</p>
<p>Russo and Lejeune had been buried along with an accomplice of Dutroux who had allowed the girls to die while in his charge. Dutroux killed him in retalliation, police said.</p>
<p>Dutroux, in jail at the time for violent theft, is seen as the mastermind behind a kidnapping and possibly child trafficking gang which also included his second wife.</p>
<p>Two other young girls, An Marchal and Eefje Lambrecks, whom he has admitted kidnapping, are still missing. The search for them has crossed borders.</p>
<p>Parents and the public prosecutor in charge of the case are hopeful they can be found alive.</p>
<p>British Detective Superintendent John Bennett, who led the investigation into the &quot;House of Horrors&quot; murders in Gloucester, western England, arrived on Wednesday to offer advice.</p>
<p>Sophisticated heat-seeking and radar equipment used in the Gloucester inquiry will be used to ensure no further bodies are hidden at Dutroux's various properties.</p>
<p>At least 15 children have vanished in Belgium in the past six years. Seven have now been found dead. Six are missing. Only two have been rescued. Police said more bodies could be found.</p>
