<p>The ringgit was bound in a tight range against the dollar but gained slightly against the Singapore dollar as the market looked for fresh leads to trade on, dealers said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>They said fresh buying against Singapore dollar out of Singapore pushed up the ringgit slightly, though gains were limited as some others unwound ringgit/Sing positions.</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone is waiting for fresh leads,&quot; said a dealer with a local bank.</p>
<p>He said trading in dollar/ringgit was confined to a tight range for lack of any factors to trade on.  </p>
<p>But dealers said the ringgit was expected to weaken slightly as the ringgit/Sing unwinding continued on fears that Malaysia will announce trade deficit in the next few months.</p>
<p>The dealers said many players have built up huge long ringgit positions against the Sing to take advantage of higher interest rates in Malaysia.</p>
<p>&quot;The perception is that trade figures in the next few months will be bad,&quot; a Singapore-based European bank dealer said.</p>
<p>At 0900 GMT, the ringgit was at 2.4927/37 per dollar against 2.4925/35 at close of Kuala Lumpur on Tuesday.</p>
