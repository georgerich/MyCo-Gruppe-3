<p>French shares ended slightly higher on Friday after spending most of the day in the red on profit-taking after a big rise on Thursday on unexpected interest rate cuts in Germany and France.</p>
<p>Wall Street's recovery from a lower start caused by higher than expected July durable goods orders pulled shares back.</p>
<p>The blue-chip CAC-40 index closed up 3.06 points or 0.15 percent at 2,020.82 while the CAC-40 futures contract was down at 2,023.5 from 2,025 on Thursday's close.</p>
<p>The August account, which closed on Friday, showed a respectable 66.72 point gain over the July account, the worst since September 1995, which closed at 1.954.1.</p>
<p>&quot;There are still too many uncertainties to really start buying French shares,&quot; a dealer said, noting upcoming budget talks and threatened social unrest in the autumn.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Alain Juppe is due to meet President Jacques Chirac at his summer residence this weekend to hammer out budget and tax cut details. Finance Minister Jean Arthuis on Thursday lowered his 1997 GDP growth forecast to between 2.25 and 2.5 percent from up to 2.8 percent.</p>
<p>Juppe attracted opposition and labour union protests over the eviction of 300 African immigrants from a church on Friday but government parties expressed their support.</p>
<p>Volume was a modest 3.2 billion francs.</p>
<p>Retailer Promodes closed 2.58 percent higher at 1,270 francs, though off its highs, after newspaper reported the retailer could soon sell its German assets to Spar AG.</p>
<p>A spokesman said the German dossier would be closed in early September or October. First half results are due September 10.</p>
