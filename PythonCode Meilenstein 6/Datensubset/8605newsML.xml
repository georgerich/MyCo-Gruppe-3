<p>Import pressure continued on Zimbabwe's interbank market on Thursday, pushing the local currency lower against hard units in early morning trade, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is very volatile at the moment. People have been expecting the (central) Reserve Bank to come in (with U.S. dollars) to support our dollar but the little they brought in this morning was not enough, and people did not even move the (exchange) rates,&quot; commented one.</p>
<p>Dealers discounted any connection between the Zimbabwe dollar's fall and a nation-wide strike by civil servants for pay hikes.</p>
<p>&quot;The fall has nothing to do with the strike. It's just that this week there have been a lot of outflows towards loan repayments,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>The dollar opened Thursday's session at 10.0500/0900 against the U.S. unit but by 0800 GMT it was quoted in a wider 10.0500/1200 spread. This compared with late Wednesday's 10.0450/0650.</p>
<p>On the crosses, the local unit against sterling was at 15.5610/6770 from 15.5620/6020 and at 6.7700/8190 from 6.7740/7890 on the mark.</p>
<p>Against the rand it was easier at 2.2000/2180 compared to 2.2000/2070 overnight.</p>
