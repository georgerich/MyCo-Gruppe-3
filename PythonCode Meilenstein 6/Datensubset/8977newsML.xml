<headline>NWE gas oil firmer, Brazil snaps up 60,000 tonnes.</headline>

<p>Brazil, which has bought 300,000 tonnes of gas oil out of the Mediterranean over the past month, turned its attention to North West Europe on Thursday and picked up some 60,000 tonnes of Russian.</p>
<p>Prices were strong across all grades as outright prices were pulled higher by surging futures, traders said.</p>
<p>A trading house took advantage of a transatlantic arbitrage window and sold 58,000 tonnes loading on August 26 from Ventspils to Brazil.</p>
<p>European buying interest for Russian cargoes was a little slack otherwise, but limited prompt supply kept premiums firm.</p>
<p>Bids ranged from Sept IPE +75 cents/+$1.25 per tonne and offers seen at +$1.75/+2.0.</p>
<p>The IPE September contract closed $3.0 higher at $191.00 per tonne on technical buying supported by low distillate stocks in the United States.</p>
<p>There were signs that some players were gearing up for the introduction of EU 0.05 percent sulphur regulations in October. A French refinery bought two low sulphur cargoes from a Norwegian refiner at Sept IPE +$11, cif Le Havre and also picked up a third cargo from Algeria.</p>
