<p>Israeli-PLO relations reached crisis point on Thursday, rocked by a flap over a West Bank flight by Yasser Arafat and a planned meeting between the Palestinian president and former Israeli leader Shimon Peres.</p>
<p>Israel angered Arafat by holding up for three hours permission to fly over its territory by helicopter to the West Bank town of Ramallah for a scheduled meeting with Peres.</p>
<p>Palestinians said Arafat cancelled an Israeli-PLO meeting on civilian affairs in protest and that the Palestinian leader would meet Peres later in the day in self-ruled Gaza.</p>
<p>Palestinian peace negotiator Hassan Asfour charged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has accused opposition Labour party leader Peres of trying to undermine his Likud government's authority, of personally barring the flight.</p>
<p>Netanyahu's election last May dismayed Palestinians, who won limited self-rule in the West Bank and Gaza and a promise from the former Labour government to negotiate a final peace.</p>
<p>The right-wing leader opposes trading occupied land for peace and has refused to meet Arafat since taking office.</p>
<p>Netanyahu has accused Nobel peace laureate Peres of &quot;sticking spokes in the wheels of peace&quot; by meeting Arab leaders while in opposition.</p>
<p>David Bar-Illan, Netanyahu's communications director, blasted Peres over the Arafat meeting and suggested the opposition leader retire from politics and accept an &quot;elder statesman's&quot; role if he wanted to continue his peace efforts.</p>
<p>&quot;I think his visit with Arafat is ill-advised and borders on the irresponsible,&quot; Bar-Illan told Reuters. &quot;Arafat will be strengthened or reinforced in his intransigence. He will not make the sort of concessions we expect him to make so that the process can continue.&quot;</p>
<p>Netanyahu has demanded that Arafat close offices in Arab East Jerusalem which the Israeli government has charged carries out work for the Palestinian Authority, which is barred by peace deals from activity in the city.</p>
<p>Yossi Beilin, a former minister in Peres's cabinet, said the Labour party chief had every right to meet Arafat.</p>
<p>&quot;How can someone think he can stop the head of the opposition from meeting Mr. Yasser Arafat? These are two people who brought about such great changes in the history of the region,&quot; Beilin told Israel radio.</p>
<p>Israel's Army radio said Arafat's flight to Ramallah was delayed because Israel had to complete safety checks of his helicopter. A spokesman for Arafat, citing a heavy schedule, said the visit would take place on Monday.</p>
<p>Palestinian Council Speaker Ahmed Korei said that by delaying the flight, Israel had committed a &quot;flagrant violation&quot; of an agreement allowing Arafat to fly between self-ruled enclaves under PLO control.</p>
<p>Bar-Illan dismissed the accusation, saying technical problems rather than political ones had kept Arafat grounded in Gaza.</p>
<p>Korei said Arafat had previously flown between Gaza and the West Bank in an Egyptian helicopter but that Thursday's flight was to have been the first in a Palestinian aircraft.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe that this is only an attempt to insult the Palestinian people by delaying and obstructing the work of the president,&quot; Korei told Reuters.</p>
