<p>The Dutch cocoa trade reported a smattering of interest from industry customers this week, which some said may herald the market returning to more normal levels of activity, although others were less optimistic.</p>
<p>&quot;We've seen a couple of spot enquiries for butter and liquor so this might be the start of better things to come,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>He said he believed German chocolate manufacturers were behind the enquiries but added a further rise in London-traded futures could easily snuff out the fragile increase in demand.</p>
<p>Second-month benchmark December cocoa was trading close to 1,050 stg a tonne, up around 25 stg on the previous week.</p>
<p>Other industry sources were less enthusiastic, saying levels of trade remained in the doldrums. This had pressured physical differentials with supplies weighing on the market, they added.</p>
<p>&quot;Shippers are keen to sell to the market but there still aren't any buyers, differentials are coming down,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>Another physical trader noted there were some cheaper offers from shippers around but said quantities were &quot;insignificant&quot;.</p>
<p>Origins mentioned included Nigerian, Cameroon and Malaysian.</p>
<p>&quot;It's still very, very slack and I don't think the main differentials have traded at all, which makes it very difficult to see where they should be,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Amsterdam's cocoa stocks are still massive, with industry sources putting them at over 600,000 tonnes, far higher than the latest SGS estimate of just below 500,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>Dutch warehousing sources have described this as their best year ever as cocoa has poured into the port in the past few months to be delivered against the squeezed September contract.</p>
<p>Sources said the long and the short positions involved in the summer battle appear now to be set but added the jury remained out on what will happen if or once delivery is taken.</p>
<p>&quot;We could still see some fireworks once September gets under way,&quot; one trader said. --Amsterdam newsroom +31 20 504 5000</p>
