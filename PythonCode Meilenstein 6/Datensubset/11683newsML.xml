<p>Japanese Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda opened talks with Syrian leaders in Damascus on Friday on what Japan could offer to break a deadlock in Arab-Israeli peace negotiations.</p>
<p>Officials said that Ikeda, who arrived from Egypt on the second leg of a regional tour, would also discuss with his Syrian counterpart Farouq al-Shara how to promote economic cooperation with Syria which has received more than $1.5 billion in aid from Japan since 1973.</p>
<p>&quot;As you know the peace process in the Middle East region is facing a very difficult phase now. Japan would like to explain to the Syrian side that it would be ready to exert any effort to maintain the peace process and to push it forward,&quot; Ikeda told reporters on arrival in Damascus.</p>
<p>&quot;We are ready to exert any role whether it is economic or political.&quot;</p>
<p>Syria's peace talks with Israel are stalled over the fate of the Golan Heights, captured by Israel in 1967, and future ties.</p>
<p>Ikeda is due to meet president Hafez al-Assad on Saturday before heading to Jordan. He will also visit Israel, the Palestinian self-rule areas and Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Japanese officials said Ikeda would visit later on Friday the Japanese military unit serving in the Golan within the United Nations Disengagement and Obeservation Force (UNDOF).</p>
<p>The 45-man Japanese unit started its mission which is mainly a logistic one in February.</p>
<p>&quot;The decision to send the unit reflects our keen desire not to limit our contribution only to the economic development but also to the efforts aimed at maintaining peace in the area,&quot; a Japanese official told Reuters.</p>
<p>He said Ikeda would sign an agreement on Saturday for a 1.022 billion yen ($9.46 million) grant to help finance the construction of an electric power training centre in Syria.</p>
<p>The grant is connected with a 1991 soft loan of 51.598 billion yen to build a power station project in Jandar, 140 km (90 miles) north of Damascus, the official said.</p>
<p>Japanese aid began to flow to Syria in 1973 with a 8.858 billion yen item for an irrigation project in Meskene area in Aleppo, 350 km (220 miles) north of Damascus, he said.</p>
<p>He said loans, grants and technical aid given to Syria since then totalled about 164.609 billion yen -- about $1.5 billion at the current exchange rate.</p>
