<p>The mark tumbled against its European satellites after the Bundesbank hacked a hefty 30 basis points off its repo rate, shocking a market which had been braced for steady policy or a modest easing at most.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a clear signal by the Bundesbank that they want a weaker deutschemark -- today's easing is much larger than anticipated,&quot; said Nick Stamenkovic, economist at DKB International in London.</p>
<p>But the bank's hopes of a weaker mark could be dashed if the market took the view the easing cycle was now over, he said.  </p>
<p>&quot;This move is so aggressive that the market may think this is the bottom of the interest rate cycle,&quot; said Stamenkovic.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't necessarily think that's the case, but if the markets did take that view and the mark failed to respond, then it would put pressure on the Bundesbank to cut again later.&quot;</p>
<p>The mark was trading at 3.4092/95 French francs and 1018.10/40 Italian lire by 1115 GMT. It had been trading at around 3.42 francs and 1022 lire just before the repo move.</p>
<p>The franc, in particular, cheered the move as it opened the way for the Bank of France to follow suit with its own badly-needed interest rate cut, analysts said.  </p>
<p>The Bank of France responded with a 20 basis point slice off its intervention rate, lowering it to 3.35 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sure the Bundesbank did it with one eye on the French,&quot; said Julian Jessop, chief European economist at Nikko Europe. But with heavy market jitters over France's fiscal and structural economic problems in the run-up to its 1997 budget, the franc may not bask in glory for long, he warned.</p>
<p>&quot;This has bought the French franc another month or so, but it's not enough to solve the doubts about the pace of European economic recovery. It may well be that the Bundesbank has to cut both the repo and the discount rate again,&quot; said Jessop.  </p>
<p>&quot;The risk is that people dismiss this as the last (German) cut in the current cycle,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The market had been awash with varying expectations ahead of today's Bundesbank council meeting. Some had seen no policy change, while some anticipated a cut of five to 10 basis points or 20 at the most. The aggressive Bundesbank move took almost everyone by surprise.</p>
<p>Analysts said the move reflected the slowdown in German July M3 -- growth fell to 8.6 percent from June's 9.6 -- and the mark's rise following the bank's failure to ease after its last council meeting.  </p>
<p>&quot;A three-percent repo is very low and will likely be seen as the floor in the current cycle. Inflation and real economy data will need to be very weak for further cuts,&quot; said Jeremy Hawkins, senior economic adviser at BankAmerica here.</p>
<p>Elsewhere on the crosses, the mark fell to 4.4330/60 Swedish crowns from late Wednesday's European level of 4.4510/40 and to 84.36/37 pesetas from 84.64/65.</p>
<p>Belgium also followed Germany's lead, cutting its central rate to 3.00 percent from 3.20. The Belgian franc was quoted at 20.5965/80 per mark by 1146 GMT versus its previous European close of around 20.6020/40.  </p>
<p>&quot;The bottom line...is good news for all the other EMS members for now, but still plenty of potential problems down the road,&quot; said BankAmerica's Hawkins.</p>
<p>Analysts said the Bundesbank's move had shown its desire to maintain the momentum of German economic recovery and to insure against the risk of a stronger mark hampering that recovery.</p>
<p>And the fact that most of those expecting an easing had anticipated a stage-by-stage ratcheting down in the repo was sure to have influenced its decision, said Nikko's Jessop.</p>
<p>&quot;They like to surprise and they've given us the full whack in one go,&quot; he said.</p>
