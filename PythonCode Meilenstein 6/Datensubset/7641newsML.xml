<p>The chairman of leading Lithuanian commercial bank Vilnius Bank said on Thursday he was happy with first-half earnings given tough market conditions.</p>
<p>Lithuania at the start of the year was stuck in a banking crisis, caused by the closure of two of its top banks.</p>
<p>Vilnius Bank earlier reported a first-half net income of 11.69 million litas ($2.9 million) , a 32 percent rise on the first quarter.</p>
<p>&quot;This was a satisfactory result especially in the light of the uncertain operating conditions at the beginning of the year,&quot; Vilnius Bank chairman Julius Niedvaras said in a statement.</p>
<p>The bank's net interest income was 17.11 million litas, of which it said 4.9 million litas came from government T-bills.</p>
<p>It said its lending grew by just 7.2 percent over the first six months of the year to 180.8 million litas due to a selective lending policy.</p>
<p>Client deposits grew by 16.7 percent to 284.4 million litas since the start of 1996 to end June.</p>
<p>It said its capital adequacy ratio rose to 14.24 percent from 12.09 percent at the start of the year.</p>
