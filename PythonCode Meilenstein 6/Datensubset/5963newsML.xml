<headline>Hungary OTC share prices peak as turnover drops.</headline>

<p>Regional electricity supplier share prices have stabilised on the Hungarian over-the-counter (OTC) market, traders said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The rise of electricity supplier share prices has virtually stopped. They jumped the week before last, but now there are more and more shares on offer, and buyers' interest is not so high,&quot; said Sandor Jagri of Procent Hungaria brokerage.</p>
<p>Shares of electricity supplier Edasz remain the most attractive, he added. Edasz share prices last week averaged some 5,200 forints.</p>
<p>Bank shares could give some sparkle to the OTC market, as privatisation news continue to emerge, traders said, adding that Budapest Bank share prices look steady at around 70 percent of their nominal value, or 7,000 forints.</p>
<p>&quot;In the past prices rose to 75 percent only to fall back to 40 percent, but now they have been holding the 70 percent level for a while,&quot; said Jagri.</p>
<p>Shares in Magyar Hitelbank are already relatively high, thus some investors find relatively cheap Kereskedelmi es Hitelbank shares an interesting option, he added.</p>
<p>OTP share prices have registered a marginal growth over the last days, but could continue to improve further, in line with bourse prices, traders said.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, OTP Bank soared 295 forints, or 13.11 percent, on the Budapest Stock Exchange (BSE), to end at 2,545.</p>
<p>While share prices on the OTC market have mostly mirrored movements on the Budapest bourse, turnover remains almost insignificant by comparison.</p>
<p>Figures released by the BSE show an OTC share turnover of 34 million forints for the week ending August 18, down from 107 million the week before. This compares to last week's BSE spot share turnover of 4.5 billion forints.</p>
