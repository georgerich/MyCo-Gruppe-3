<p>Intermonth Brent spreads and CFD values held gains on Thursday, but differentials for physical grades were little changed as wet traders stepped off the gas after Wednesday's flurry of physical deals.</p>
<p>Oct Brent paper eased off highs late, but was still 45 cents up at $20.65 a barrel by 1751 GMT.</p>
<p>Sep/Oct Brent held onto gains of some ten cents on the day, and was pegged at +55/59 cents in late talk, having traded twice at +58 cents. The Oct/Nov spread was talked firm at +44/48 cents.</p>
<p>CFDs for next week traded up at Oct Brent +38 and +40 cents.</p>
<p>In the Mediterranean, no new deals reported on the sour Urals crude market.</p>
<p>Traders said this was likely to put pressure on differentials with Urals seen doable at Dated -80/85 cents.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a lot of Urals moving north and into the Black Sea but it's weaker,&quot; a trader for an oil major said.</p>
<p>While most September loadings from Odessa were tied up for the first half of September, several small cargoes on offer for October loading. --London Newsroom +44 171 542 5387</p>
