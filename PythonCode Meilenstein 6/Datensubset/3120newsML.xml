<p>French Defence Minister Charles Millon said on Tuesday that Paris had no plans to cut back its military presence in Africa.</p>
<p>Millon, speaking in Senegal on the first leg of a trip that will also take him to Ivory Coast, said that this was the message he had come to deliver to African officials.</p>
<p>&quot;There will be no substantial change in France's military presence in Africa,&quot; he told reporters.</p>
<p>Millon, who arrived in Senegal on Monday, told Radio France International that there was no question of modifying France's pre-positioned military presence in the world.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no question of going back on the forces currently based in Senegal or Ivory Coast and that is what I have come to tell African, and particularly Senegalese, officials,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Millon said prevention of conflict was an essential role for the French army. &quot;There will be adjustments here and there in the light of redefined support or redefined missions but there will be no massive reduction in numbers,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>France has about 1,300 troops stationed in Senegal, a former French colony.</p>
<p>It has about 500 soldiers in Ivory Coast and contingents in Chad, Djibouti, Gabon and the Central African Republic, where it intervened in May under a defence pact to prevent an army revolt toppling elected president Ange-Felix Patasse.</p>
