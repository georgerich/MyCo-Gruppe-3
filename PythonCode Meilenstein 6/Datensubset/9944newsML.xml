<p>Eight South Korean tourists were rescued from an icy river on Thursday after their vehicle plunged from a bridge on New Zealand's South Island, police said.</p>
<p>The eight were in a minibus which skidded on the Kawarau bridge near the tourist resort of Queenstown. It crashed through barriers and fell about 12 metres (40 feet) into the river.</p>
<p>Two of the passengers were flown to hospital in the city of Invercargill. Radio New Zealand said they were a 35-year-old man who was critically ill and and eight-year-old boy with moderate injuries.</p>
<p>The other six people were taken to a local hospital but were not seriously injured.</p>
<p>Department of Conservation officer Brian Ahern said the group was lucky to survive the plunge. Road conditions at the time were treacherous, with ice on the ground and falling snow.</p>
