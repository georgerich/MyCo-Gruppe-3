<p>Up to 4,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees abandoned their camp in northern Burundi on Wednesday, heading for Rwanda in the biggest movement back to their homeland since they fled in 1994.</p>
<p>Paul Stromberg, spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Rwanda, said 3,000 to 4,000 refugees left Magara camp in northern Burundi before heavy rain slowed the exodus.</p>
<p>The UNHCR had revised its estimate of the number of refugees remaining in the camp down to some 6,000.</p>
<p>On Tuesday a total of 4,500 refugees returned to Rwanda from Magara before an aid agency operation to help them was suspended because heavy rains made a road to Musange transit camp near Butare impassable.</p>
<p>Refugees accuse the Tutsi-dominated Burundian army, which seized power on July 25, of a deliberate campaign of harassment and say they are leaving because they fear for their lives.</p>
<p>The flood of Rwandan Hutus this month from Burundi is the biggest mass movement homewards since a total of two million Rwandan Hutus fled to Burundi, Tanzania and Zaire in 1994 during civil war and the genocide of up to one million people, mostly minority Tutsis, by Hutus.</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of Rwandan Hutus remain in exile in camps in Zaire.</p>
<p>&quot;It is good to return. I have not seen Rwanda since August 1994,&quot; said refugee Tharcisse Nyanranzima, unloading plastic sheeting, a bucket and his brother's artificial limb off a lorry at Musange transit camp five km (three miles) outside Butare.</p>
<p>&quot;We should have come home before but the rumours and lies in the Burundi camps are incredible,&quot; said Nyanranzima on Tuesday as sodden refugees sloshed through thick mud towards the camp.</p>
<p>Hardline Hutus among the refugees say they fear they will be killed if they return to Rwanda in reprisal for the genocide.</p>
<p>Stromberg said if the refugee flow continued Magara could be emptied of those refugees who wanted to go home in a few days. UNHCR is in talks with Burundian authorities to establish what would happen to Rwandans who refused to go home.</p>
<p>The refugee flood swelled after Burundian troops killed three refugees as they tried to flee Magara camp on Sunday. The army said soldiers fired after a Rwandan refugee shot at them.</p>
<p>Some refugees also stoned soldiers at Magara camp after refusing to tear down shelters left empty by returning refugees.</p>
<p>&quot;During the rock throwing incident at Magara it was clear that there are groups who desperately do not want to go back. We hope they will not stop others going back,&quot; Stromberg said.</p>
<p>He said after all those refugees who wanted to leave Magara had done so a repatriation campaign would move on to the last Rwandan refugee camp in Burundi at Rukuramigabo, which has some 13,000 Rwandans.</p>
<p>There were 135,000 Rwandan refugees in Burundi at the start of the year.</p>
<p>Stromberg said at least 143 returning refugees have been detained by Rwanda's Tutsi-led authorities since mid-July.</p>
<p>Burundi's new Tutsi military leader Pierre Buyoya pledged on Tuesday to protect the Rwandan refugees in line with international conventions and said a team of investigators had been sent to northern Burundi to check on their complaints.</p>
<p>Burundian army officers have accused the Rwandan Hutu refugees of backing Burundian Hutu rebels infiltrating Burundi.</p>
