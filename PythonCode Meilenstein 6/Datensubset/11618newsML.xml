<p>NWE gas oil edged higher on on Friday as futures improved on Thursday's gains and premiums remained firm, traders said.</p>
<p>On the barge market, prices were unchanged. Premiums were put at Sept IPE +25 cents/+$1. Traders said recent gains on futures had scared buyers off and the market was very quiet. &quot;The high screen prices have put buyers off.&quot;</p>
<p>The Sept IPE contract was trading 25 cents higher at $191.25 per tonne at 1231 GMT, after ending +$3 higher on Thursday.</p>
<p>On the cargo market, there was good buying interest out of France for low sulphur material.</p>
<p>Premiums were put at Sept IPE +$10.50/+$11.50 cif NWE.</p>
<p>A French refiner, reported to have bought three cargoes already this week, was said to be back in the market for more.</p>
<p>A cargo of German heating oil was traded at Sept IPE +$3.75 cif Hamburg for Sept 1-10 delivery. A German refiner was also looking for a cargo of DIN and bidding Sept IPE +$3 per tonne -- offers, however, were 50 cents to $1 higher.</p>
<p>Traders said premiums on Russian material were steady at Sept IPE +$1/+$2 per tonne.</p>
