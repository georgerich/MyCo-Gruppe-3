<p>Hundreds of Liberian refugees evicted from the U.S. embassy housing compound have been taken to new shelters outside Monrovia, aid workers said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>They were among up to 20,000 people who took refuge at the Graystone compound, close to the embassy in the city's Mamba Point district, at the height of fighting between rival factions in the city in April and May.</p>
<p>Embassy security guards tore down their makeshift shelters on Monday after the expiry of a deadline for them to leave. The refugees gathered outside the gate with their belongings, demanding help with resettlement.</p>
<p>&quot;Ten family heads were relocated yesterday but the rest of them slept right here in these garages and abandoned offices last night. Now they are going to regular camps,&quot; said a spokesman for British charity Tear Fund.</p>
<p>The U.S. embassy says Monrovia is now returning to normal and it wants to give its staff their houses back.</p>
<p>The compound was protected from the fighting by a high wall and by security guards. An impromptu market for looted goods sprang up inside and Liberian aid workers set up a clinic treating bullet wounds, diarrhoea and other ailments.</p>
<p>West African leaders and Liberian warlords agreed a new peace plan in the Nigerian capital on Saturday, detailing a timetable for disarming militias and setting a target date of May 30 for elections.</p>
