<p>Gunmen thought to be Islamist militants shot dead three men in southern Egypt on Thursday, apparently in the belief that they were police collaborators, security sources said.</p>
<p>The victims were Mahmoud Abdelhakim Abdel Nasser, 68, who previously held the post of local head of the police auxiliaries, and two of his sons -- Marei, a 38-year-old teacher, and Reda, a 33-year-old farmer, they said.</p>
<p>The attack took place in the village of Naway near Mallawi, in the Nile valley about 260 km (160 miles) south of Cairo.</p>
<p>Full details of the attack were not available but the gunmen escaped and police are hunting them.</p>
<p>Police suspect the attack was the work of the militant al-Gama'a al-Islamiya (Islamic Group), the largest organisation fighting to overthrow the government and make Egypt a strict Islamic state. The Gama'a often kills suspected collaborators.</p>
<p>In the nearby village of Qalandul on Wednesday, gunmen shot dead two Christian brothers, apparently police informers.</p>
<p>Mallawi district, in Minya province, has been the centre of most of the political violence in Egypt for the past two years.</p>
<p>Nearly 1,000 people, mainly police and militants, have been killed in the past four years of violence.</p>
<p>Armed civilians are now allowed to take part in patrols with the security forces in southern provinces to fight against the militants, the sources said.</p>
