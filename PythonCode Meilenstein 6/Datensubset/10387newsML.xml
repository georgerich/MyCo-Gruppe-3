<p>Oman on Friday said new U.S. economic measures against Iran would not resolve disputes between Washington and Tehran and urged a dialogue instead, the official Oman News Agency reported.</p>
<p>&quot;This policy of economic pressure and isolation will not lead to an end of the problems but will complicate them,&quot; it quoted Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Youssef bin Alawi bin Abdullah as saying.</p>
<p>He said only &quot;dialogue and understanding based on the principle of respect&quot; would end the differences.</p>
<p>He was referring to the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act which U.S. President Bill Clinton signed on August 5 empowering him to penalise non-U.S. firms investing $40 million or more a year in Iran or Libya's oil and gas industries.</p>
<p>Oman, which shares the only entrance to the Gulf with Iran, has a close working relationship with Tehran but is also one of Washington's longtime Arab allies.</p>
<p>&quot;We will not accept anything that will have an effect on trade relations between us and Iran,&quot; Abdullah said.</p>
<p>The United States, which accuses Iran of sponsoring international terrorism, has embarked on an economic and political campaign to isolate the Islamic republic. Tehran denies the charges.</p>
<p>Oman is a member of the Gulf Cooperation Council, a military, economic and political alliance that also includes Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Qatar.</p>
