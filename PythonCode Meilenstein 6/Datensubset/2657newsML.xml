<p>South Africa's rugby managers made peace with Sports Minister Steve Tshwete on Tuesday, defusing criticism that too little was being done to bring blacks into the white-dominated game.</p>
<p>Tshwete told a news conference after meeting South African Rugby Football Union (Sarfu) chief executive Riaan Oberholzer and development director Sas Bailey that he was &quot;satisfied&quot; with the union's development programme.</p>
<p>&quot;There has been a great deal of turmoil in the last few days for the image of rugby in this country,&quot; the minister said.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a strong perception that rugby remains the exclusive reserve of white players and supporters and that SARFU is trapped in the twilight of the past and not taking rugby development seriously.&quot;</p>
<p>Tshwete publically critised Sarfu in weekend newspapers for not producing a strategic plan for developing black and mixed-race players.</p>
<p>He also slammed white fans who had waved the old South African flag during recent matches.</p>
<p>But after Tuesday's talks, he said he recognised the efforts Sarfu was making and that the Department of Sport would link up with Sarfu to form a South African rugby foundation to focus on players from disadvantaged communities.</p>
