<p>London Metal Exchange (LME) three months copper was unchanged from the afternoon kerb close of $1,935 by 1800 GMT when Comex ended after very subdued late inter-office activity.</p>
<p>Business had been slow throughout the day ahead of a three-day UK holiday weekend and US Labour Day next week with copper confined in a tight range between $1,929 and $1,939.</p>
<p>Brokerage Rudolf Wolff calls the market &quot;confused&quot;.</p>
<p>IT says it is likely to remain so until business picks up after the summer slowdown &quot;when we will get a clearer picture as to whether the supply surplus is going to start mounting up&quot;.</p>
<p>Aluminium is also entrenched in a band, between $1,484 and $1,490, and had an uninspiring Thursday session.</p>
<p>It ended the kerb at $1,487, down $3, and was bid at that level by the hour of the Comex close.</p>
<p>Nickel showed most life during Thursday when it was boosted by trade buying and buy-stop activity to extend its rally above resistance at $7,300.</p>
<p>But profit-taking restricted further gains and it ended the kerb $7,360, versus $7,250 on Wednesday. Nickel was assessed just stronger in late inter-office dealings and was bid at $7,370 by 1800 GMT.</p>
