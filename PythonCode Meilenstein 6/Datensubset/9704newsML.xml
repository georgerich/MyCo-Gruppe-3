<p>Australia signalled on Thursday that it would take the lead in rescuing a nuclear test ban treaty by sponsoring a U.N. resolution which would bypass India's veto on the pact.</p>
<p>After Iran used procedural wrangling to prevent the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva from making its final report on the failed negotiations, Australian ambassador Richard Starr said the treaty could not be allowed to die after years of work.</p>
<p>&quot;We cannot give up. The opportunity is here now, it will not last,&quot; Starr said. &quot;We must grasp it or lose it and with it the whole critical step towards nuclear disarmament.&quot;</p>
<p>Western diplomats expect Australia to sponsor a resolution at the U.N. General Assembly calling for the treaty to be opened for signature despite the Indian and Iranian opposition.</p>
<p>&quot;The Australians are getting ready. They have prepared a text and are showing it around to get opinions,&quot; said one diplomat, adding that he expected an announcement on Friday.</p>
<p>India vetoed adoption of the draft Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), which would ban all nuclear explosions, in the Geneva body two days ago.</p>
<p>It says it opposes the draft because it does not commit the five declared nuclear powers -- Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States -- to a timetable for dismantling their arsenals.</p>
<p>However, treaty backers still hope to send the text to the General Assembly for signature next month, according to a timetable set by the 185-member world body last December.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a workable treaty and we have a commitment by the five nuclear weapon states to endorse and sign it,&quot; Starr said in a speech at the close of the morning session in Geneva.</p>
<p>&quot;It is in the interests of this conference that, given this paralysis, its work be taken to the broader international community, recognised and endorsed.</p>
<p>&quot;Accordingly, Australia will be looking to work with friends of the CTBT to fulfil the goal of the 50th General Assembly of a completed text, endorsed and ready for signature by the 51st assembly this year.&quot;</p>
<p>Starr told reporters the decision rested with his government in Canberra and he hoped it would come &quot;shortly&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;My government has said quite clearly that we do not want this text to die in the ad hoc committee,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>U.S. ambassador Stephen Ledogar, asked whether Australia was expected to bring the text to the General Assembly, replied: &quot;It looks like they will be playing an important role.&quot;</p>
<p>The conference had been expected to wrap up its work on the CTBT by adopting the committee's report summarising more than two years of negotiations and stating no consensus was reached.</p>
<p>But Iran's envoy Sirous Nasseri set off more than two hours of heated procedural debate on whether to accept a proposal by Pakistan to send the committee's final report to New York.</p>
<p>&quot;Pakistan was just trying to goad India,&quot; one envoy said. &quot;Neither India nor Iran want to help the process in New York.&quot;</p>
<p>Poland's envoy Ludwik Dembinski, who currently chairs the 61-member conference, held consultations before a resumed meeting at five p.m. (1500 GMT).</p>
<p>But Nasseri said he doubted whether he would be able to get instructions from tehran by the end of day because it was a holiday there.</p>
<p>Influential non-aligned states including Pakistan, Mexico, Brazil, Egypt, Peru and Chile backed the treaty on Thursday.</p>
<p>Pakistan's envoy Munir Akram read out his country's simple proposal: &quot;The Conference on Disarmament decides to transmit immediately the report of its ad hoc commitee on the nuclear test ban treaty to the U.N. General Assembly.&quot;</p>
<p>But Iran's Nasseri repeatedly objected that Pakistan's proposal was not appropriately formatted and did not respect rules of procedure allowing delegations two weeks to decide.</p>
<p>Ledogar said in a brief speech: &quot;I wish to make clear that the United States supports this treaty text as it is.</p>
<p>&quot;We call on those delegations which have not yet done so to join with us in support of this text.&quot;</p>
<p>Nearly identical statements were read out by Russia's Grigory Berdennikov, China's Sha Zukang, France's Joelle Bourgois and Britain's Sir Michael Weston.</p>
<p>Later Sha left the morning debate, telling reporters: &quot;It is a waste of time. I am fed up.&quot;</p>
