<p>White sugar futures clung near to their opening levels in lacklustre Friday trading as market players took low-risk strategies ahead of the extended holiday weekend, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think anyone really wants to stick their neck out on the whites,&quot; said one, adding that a sudden move in New York while London was closed would immediately affect the whites market when it re-opens on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The LCE is closed on Monday due to a public holiday.</p>
<p>At 1629 GMT overall volume reached a scant 531 lots.</p>
<p>Traded positions were lightly mixed. October was up 30 cents at $352.00, just 50 cents off its intraday high but still a long way off its life-high of $355.50, tested earlier this week.</p>
<p>December was off 10 cents at $345.80.</p>
<p>Activity on the Paris market was unimpressive and price movements were slight. October was up 10 cents at $352.40 and December down 50 cents at $347.00.</p>
<p>Matif volume amounted to 344 lots.</p>
