<text>
<p>Interior Minister Jean-Louis Debre said about a third of some 300 African immigrants evicted from a Paris church on Friday will be allowed to stay in France.</p>
<p>He told reporters that the personal or family situation of &quot;30 to 40 percent&quot; of them met the government's criteria to grant them residence permits.</p>
<p>Debre said some other protesters had already been served expulsion orders which he said would be enforced.</p>
<p>He was looking into the case of an unspecified number of other protesters, and those among them who were not entitled to stay &quot;will have to leave the country soooner or later.&quot;</p>
<p>Union sources at national airline Air France said a government-chartered flight was due to leave on Saturday for Mali, home of most of the protesters.</p>
<p>Debre said police had evacuated the Saint-Bernard church, where the protesters had been holed up for weeks, without any major incident and no-one had been injured.</p>
