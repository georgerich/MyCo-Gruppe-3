<p>Fixing activity in the Mediterranean and Black Sea sector finally picked up on Thursday, after three consecutive days of poor business, but rates got not support, shipping brokers said.</p>
<p>Other lifting sectors saw fair fixing and steady rates. Although activity picked up in the Med rates remained steady with 80,000 tonners on cross-Med trips placed around W100-102.5.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a certain amount of relief that market activity has lifted off again after a virtual standstill,&quot; said an Italian broker.  </p>
<p>&quot;We do not expect the rates to drop, neither is it likely that activity will sink back to the lows of the last seven days,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>In the Middle East fixtures dropped off slightly after a boom on Wednesday, but despite the slower fixing rates remained firm on last done levels.</p>
<p>VLCC rates for Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan remained at around W65,with tankers heading for the U.S and Europe held at W60. VLCC trips to Japan were assessed between W65-67.5. The two VLCCs fixed to Japan at W70 were a Japanese to Japanese deal and not reflective of the general market rate.  </p>
<p>In the inter-UKC sector rates on 80,000 tonners were steady around W100 although up to W105 was done.</p>
<p>There was a single transatlantic charter, with Statoil taking the 143,000 tonner, Knock Clune at W87.56 from Mongstad to USG. The Caribbean market saw rates drop very slightly. Brokers said 70,000 tonners travelling up the US coast were estimated to be in the 127.5-132 region.</p>
<p>Fixing out of West Africa slowed after the recent rash of VLCCs to the Far East and Thursday showed only suezmaxes picking up business.</p>
