<p>In Hollywood, a car chase, high-tech stunts and a bit of romance may be the formula for a hit film. But in China, Deng Xiaoping is tough to beat.</p>
<p>The diminutive politician stands head and shoulders above some of the more popular subjects in the West.</p>
<p>The latest addition to China's silver screen -- called &quot;Battles for Glory over the Taihang Mountains&quot; -- depicts the nation's paramount leader as a young man in the guerrilla war against Japanese invaders in the late 1930s and early 1940s.</p>
<p>&quot;I think Deng Xiaoping is cute,&quot; says Qin Yan, the film's director. &quot;I really like him. He has made a great contribution to modern history.&quot;</p>
<p>In more recent years, Deng's image has been tarnished, particularly by the bloody crackdown on political reform in 1989.</p>
<p>But his policies of economic pragmatism, embracing capitalist style policies, have endeared him to many Chinese, particularly those old enough to remember the fanatical leftist days under Mao Zedong.</p>
<p>The economic reforms have raised living standards dramatically and Deng can rightfully claim much of the credit.</p>
<p>&quot;We are treating him as a person. We want people to feel closer to this man,&quot; says Qin.</p>
<p>That, however, is getting harder and harder to do. In real life, Deng -- who turns 92 on Thursday -- has not been seen in public since early 1994. When last viewed he appeared to be in frail health.</p>
<p>Deng had long shunned the &quot;cult of personality&quot; that revolutionary leader Mao Zedong embraced.</p>
<p>But in his twilight years, authors, film makers and the official media have been making up for lost time, serving up a steady stream of material to ensure Deng's place in history remains intact.</p>
<p>For the ruling Communist Party, challenged by the collapse of most of its Marxist allies, there is a need for larger than life heroes, and Deng is one of the few it has.</p>
<p>For the movie makers, it also doesn't hurt. The People's Liberation Army (PLA) helped the production, providing extras, trucks and even a few armoured cars. The occupying Japanese troops in the movie are actually PLA soldiers off the screen.</p>
<p>But depicting one of Beijing's heroes has its drawbacks. The ruling Communist Party has its own view of history and does not take kindly to tinkering.</p>
<p>Beijing's &quot;leading figures&quot; film group, which pays special attention to movies about the communist pantheon, had its say in this film as in others.</p>
<p>&quot;There were lots of revisions,&quot; said Qin, a writer and former actress. &quot;There were lots of different opinions.&quot;</p>
<p>The Deng family also was consulted. They were said to be generally pleased with the outcome if less than thrilled with certain love scenes. Those scenes were cut.</p>
<p>The movie took six months and only 9 million yuan ($1.1 million) to make.</p>
<p>Shi Xin, the 23-year-old actor who portrays Deng as a young man, received a modest 10,000 yuan ($1,200) for the role, his first ever as the Chinese leader.</p>
<p>&quot;It was my first time playing Deng and he is not an ordinary man,&quot; said Shi. &quot;I was not that satisfied with my performance.&quot;</p>
<p>The modest budget reflects other changes in the industry in recent years. In the old days, there was plenty of money for movies that pleased Communist Party leaders.</p>
<p>Now, motion pictures may have party help, but they are also likely to be commercial ventures with investors taking a stake in the project in return for a share of profits.</p>
<p>&quot;I had to run around to help find investors and raise money,&quot; says Qin.</p>
<p>In an ironic footnote, that reflects the market reforms spurred by none other than Deng Xiaoping.</p>
