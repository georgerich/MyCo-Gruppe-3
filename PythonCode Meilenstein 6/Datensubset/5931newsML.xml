<p>Russian heavy guns pounded the Chechen capital Grozny on Wednesday and Moscow's top commander in the region said he was ready to attack the separatist-held city without further warning.</p>
<p>Warplanes screamed overhead and a loud explosion sounded after one flew over. A plume of black smoke then rose from the Zavodskoy district of the city, dotted with factories and oil refineries. Other parts of the city were ablaze.</p>
<p>The centre of the Grozny was almost deserted. In the once-bustling market place, a comandeered Russian armoured personnel carrier with a Chechen flag painted on it was tucked between two buildings.</p>
<p>The shelling started in the morning, well before the expiry of a deadline given by deputy Russian commander Lieutenant- General Konstantin Pulikovsky to the rebels to withdraw or face all-out bombardment.</p>
<p>Pulikovsky had not made clear when his ultimatum would expire, but Russian news media appeared to assume it would be at midnight (2000 GMT on Wednesday).</p>
<p>The top commander in the region, Lieutenant-General Vyacheslav Tikhomirov, on Wednesday backed his deputy.</p>
<p>Interfax news agency quoted Tikhomirov as saying he would give no further warning before launching an assault to recapture Grozny. &quot;They (the rebels) will not live to see further loose warnings from me,&quot; the general said.</p>
<p>The latest raids took place hours before the expected arrival of Alexander Lebed, Russia's security chief ordered by President Boris Yeltsin to restore Russian control over the city and bring peace to Chechnya.</p>
<p>Lebed, who had opposed plans to shell Grozny, was due to meet Russian officials at the Khankala military base outside the city and later meet rebels in the village of Novye Atagi, some 20 km (12 miles) to the south.</p>
<p>Rebels seized control over most of Grozny on August 6 in an operation that has humiliated Russian forces. Hundreds of people have been killed in the latest fighting and the death toll for the whole conflict runs to tens of thousands.</p>
<p>In a sign of growing concern, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has been involved in attempts to broker peace, withdrew from Grozny.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of people have fled from the city since Pulikovsky said he would use planes and artillery to clear rebels from the capital of the southern region.</p>
<p>But the flood of refugees slowed to a trickle on Wednesday after Russians appeared to have blocked the main escape route towards the northeast. Civilians trapped by fighting in Grozny cellars pleaded for help.</p>
<p>An elderly woman struggling along the road to escape the city handed over an appeal, written in ball-point pen on a flimsy sheet of paper.</p>
<p>&quot;We are living in uncertainty and confusion, we feel that we have been abandoned in our own country. We ask that you do everything possible to stop this war,&quot; it said</p>
<p>Fourteen people had signed the appeal on behalf of themselves and their families. It listed 32 names altogether, about half of them Russian.</p>
<p>Russian liberals called on Yeltsin on Tuesday to avert the threatened attack, which Yelena Bonner, widow of former Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov, said would be a &quot;crime against humanity&quot;.</p>
