<p>China has urged ailing state- owned industrial enterprises to take on more responsibility and keep losses within 1995 levels, the Financial News said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Vice Premier Wu Bangguo called on all state firms to cut losses and boost profits by taking responsibility for their own financial status and ending reliance on state subsidies, it said.</p>
<p>He was speaking at a conference on reforming China's state enterprises, held on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Money-losing state firms, suffering from declining sales and rising stockpiles, were hindering economic development and threatening social stability, Wu said.</p>
<p>The State Council wanted state industrial enterprises in some areas to keep their losses at or below the 1995 level, he said without specifying which sectors.</p>
<p>The government would continue to support state firms in severe financial difficulties like coal enterprises, and enterprises that were shifting product lines, like the textile industry, he said.</p>
<p>He urged state firms to explore international markets and upgrade technology to improve their economic performance.  </p>
<p>He added that government and state company leaders should take responsibility for results of state firms.</p>
<p>Officials in charge of a group of 32 loss-making coal enterprises recently pledged to resign if they failed to turn losses into profits, the Workers' Daily said.</p>
<p>China's state sector reported a net loss of 3.0 billion yuan ($361 million) in the first quarter of this year, the first such loss since the 1949 communist takeover.</p>
<p>Beijing has been slow to reform China's state enterprises, of which 70 percent are in the red, fearing bankruptcies and mass unemployment could spark social unrest.</p>
