<p>Bonds were nudging higher but liquidity was very thin on a day when the Treasury rejected all bids at its five-year bond sale.</p>
<p>Traders said the market was going to remain on hold until after the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting later on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no desire to do anything in either futures or cash,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>Traders said that the Treasury decision was a clear sign that it was not prepared to accept any increase in yields.  </p>
<p>Bidded yields had been expected to be higher than the previous sale on July 25 because of uncertainty over the FOMC and the fact that end-users were out of the market.</p>
<p>They said demand at the auction only totalled 36 billion for the 20 billion escudos of paper on offer.</p>
<p>The escudo was also calm.</p>
