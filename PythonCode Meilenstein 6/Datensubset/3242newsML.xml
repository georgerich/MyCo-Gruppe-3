<p>Serbia's Sartid Steel Works has raised production to pre-sanctions levels, producing over 200,000 tonnes of iron and steel in July, the Iron and Steel Industry Association said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Production in July almost reached the optimum use of capacity as it did in 1989 when it was 85 percent,&quot; Savo Markovic of the Association told Reuters.</p>
<p>In the first three months this year production was insignificant as the company prepared to resume production in the wake of war-time sanctions, he said.</p>
<p>In July Sartid, based in the east-Serbian town of Smederevo, produced 63,000 tonnes of iron, 74,000 tonnes of steel and 80,000 tonnes of finished products.</p>
<p>Sartid fired its furnace in March, and from April to the end of July produced a total of 228,000 tonnes of iron, 222,000 tonnes of steel and 222,000 tonnes of finished products.</p>
<p>&quot;This production is quite good considering Sartid stopped producing iron and steel at the beginning of 1993,&quot; said Markovic. &quot;It is even above expectations.&quot;</p>
<p>Sartid received about $122 million in credits in the past six months to kick-start the plant -- mostly from Swiss banks.</p>
<p>The money stabilised production at an average of 75 percent capacity with only one of four blast furnaces operating. Under the embargo plant ran at a mere 15 percent of its capacity.</p>
<p>Sartid's chief executive Dusan Matkovic last week said the plant's exports rose to $1 million a day after almost four years of idleness under the international trade embargo.</p>
<p>&quot;Sartid must export and pay back its debts,&quot; Markovic said. &quot;It cannot sell all its production on the domestic market.&quot;</p>
<p>The domestic market can absorb only about 15 percent of the plant's output as the republic's metal industry -- the main consumer of Sartid's products -- is still sluggish.</p>
<p>As much as 95 percent of Sartid's raw materials are imported -- crippling the factory during sanctions.</p>
<p>Sartid, according to Matkovic, plans to start its second blast furnace by the end of 1997. Its annual production then would rise to two million tonnes of steel. -- Gordana Kukic, Belgrade Newsroom, +381 11 222 4254</p>
