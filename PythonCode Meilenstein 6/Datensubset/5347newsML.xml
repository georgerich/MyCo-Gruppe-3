<p>A general strike led by Nepal's opposition communists brought much of Kathmandu to a halt on Wednesday in the first major political protest against the ruling centre-right coalition.</p>
<p>Public transport, educational institutions and businesses closed in response to the strike call by the communist-led National Mass Movement Coordination Committee (NMMCC) but some industries stayed open, witnesses said.</p>
<p>The protesters say Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba's Nepali Congress-led coalition is responsible for corruption, high inflation and unemployment in the landlocked Himalayan kingom.</p>
<p>They criticise Deuba's government for its signing in February of a treaty with India to share the waters of the Mahakali river, which they say is not fair to Nepal.</p>
<p>The treaty is now before the Nepali parliament for ratification.</p>
<p>The strikers have also accused the government of harassing innocent people and political rivals in western Nepal under the guise of a crackdown on Maoist rebels in an insurgency which has claimed more than 40 lives in the past six months.</p>
<p>Witnesses said most shops in the main business area of Kathmandu were closed and only a few taxi cabs and three-wheeled auto-rickshaws were running.</p>
<p>The strike, which came a day after the end of a three-month closure by textile mills opposing a rise in sales tax, was the first major showdown with the opposition since the government came to power last September.</p>
<p>The centre-right coalition assumed power after dislodging in a confidence vote a communist minority government which had ruled for nine months.</p>
<p>Nepal launched a multi-party democracy under a constitutional monarchy headed by King Birendra in 1990 after bloody pro-democracy demonstrations.</p>
