<p>Zenith Electronics Corp said on Thursday that it plans to build a $100 million large-screen television picture tube manufacturing plant in Woodridge, Ill., creating about 280 full-time jobs.</p>
<p>The plant is subject to financing, a company spokesman said.  </p>
<p>Zenith said it would manufacture 32-inch and 35-inch picture tubes at the new facility, which the company currently buys from its competitors, the spokesman said. Eventually, the plant will also supply wide-screen tubes for digital and high- definition television sets. Construction of the plant is expected to be completed in 1997.</p>
<p>Zenith said the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs will provide up to $600,000 in an employee-training grant over the next two years and the Illinois Department of Transportation will give $429,000 in funds to finance 50 percent of an access road to the new facility.</p>
<p>Previously, Zenith had announced it will spend $80 million to automate its existing television picture tube plant in Melrose Park, Ill. The Melrose Park project will add 120 jobs, the company said.</p>
