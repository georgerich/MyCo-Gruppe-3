<p>China sent a senior official to attend a reception at the Ukraine embassy on Friday despite a diplomatic rift over a visit to Kiev by Taiwan's vice president Lien Chan.</p>
<p>But an apparent guest list mix-up left both sides unsure over who would represent Beijing at the reception, held to mark Ukraine's independence day.</p>
<p>Ukraine's ambassador thought Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister Tian Zengpei would attend, but the Chinese thought it was Vice-Foreign Minister Zhang Deguang.</p>
<p>Zhang, however, fell ill and Vice-Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan showed up instead.</p>
<p>The confusion followed Taiwan Vice President Lien Chan's three-day trip this week to Ukraine which infuriated Beijing.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a misunderstanding...a mix-up,&quot; Ukrainian Minister-Counsellor Leonid Leshchenko told Reuters, referring to the guest list.</p>
<p>Asked if he saw it as an intentional slap on the wrist, Leshchenko shook his head and said: &quot;No, no no.&quot;</p>
<p>A Chinese Foreign Ministry protocol officer said Tian, the vice-minister that the Ukrainians were expecting, was abroad.</p>
<p>Ukrainian diplomats noted that Tang, the vice-minister who attended, was filling in for Tian as the acting first vice-minister and was actually higher in rank than the person who fell ill.</p>
<p>Ukraine's Ambassador Anatoly Plyushko emerged from a half-hour chat with Vice-Minister Tang, and said the vice-minister told him that China attached &quot;great attention to bilateral relations&quot; and &quot;hoped to continue to develop&quot; ties.</p>
<p>Plyushko said the vice-minister did not raise the issue of Lien's three-day Kiev visit.</p>
<p>&quot;All Chinese guests...invited came,&quot; Plyushko said. &quot;This is evidence...(of) their attitude towards our relations. I'm optimistic.&quot;</p>
<p>The atmosphere was less pleasant on Wednesday when the Chinese Foreign Ministry summoned Plyushko to protest against Lien's trip.</p>
<p>China regards Taiwan as a rebel province with no right to conduct foreign relations on its own, and has sought to push it into diplomatic isolation since a civil war separated them in 1949.</p>
<p>The former Soviet republic of Ukraine recognises China but not Taiwan.</p>
<p>In apparent retaliation against Lien's visit, Chinese State Councillor Li Tieying, a member of the powerful Politburo of the ruling Communist Party, has postponed a visit to Ukraine.</p>
<p>In Kiev, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Hennady Udovenko took a shot at Beijing on Thursday, saying China had over-reacted to Lien's visit and calling Beijing's protest &quot;out of proportion&quot;.</p>
