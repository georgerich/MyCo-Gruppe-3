<p>Indonesia's armed forces plan to launch a big military exercise on and around the oil-rich Natuna islands next month, the official Antara news agency said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;All types of operations and new weapons owned by the armed forces will be tested in the exercise on the Natuna islands,&quot; Lieutenant-General Wiranto, exercise director and chief of the army's strategic command (Kostrad), was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>The exercise would run from September 8-19, Wiranto said, adding: &quot;It is aimed at increasing the armed forces capabilities as a defence force.&quot;</p>
<p>Wiranto said that the armed forces had previously launched joint military exercises on the same scale in 1988 and 1992.</p>
<p>&quot;This exercise will become the biggest and most complicated,&quot; he said, adding that missiles, tanks, submarines and fighter aircraft would be used.</p>
<p>At least 19,525 personnel, including elite special forces (Kopassus), marines, and air force paratroops would take part in the exercise, Wiranto added.</p>
<p>Antara said the Natuna islands in South China Sea were chosen because of their sparse population and inaccessibility.</p>
<p>In 1994, Indonesia signed a multi-billion dollar deal with Exxon Corp of the United States to exploit the Natuna gas fields, which contain an estimated 210 trillion cubic feet of gas.</p>
<p>Indonesia recently questioned a Chinese maritime map that showed the Natunas as part of China's territory but accepted an explanation from Beijing which said they belonged to Jakarta.</p>
