<p>APEC officials ended their meeting on Friday saying they had made good progress even though there were disagreements on a United States proposal to cut tariffs on information technology and related products.</p>
<p>The three-day meeting, meant to thrash out agreement on how trade should be freed in the region, also saw disagreement over lifting a moratorium on admitting new members.</p>
<p>&quot;Overall, we are quite satisfied that the Davao meeting has met the expectation of the senior officials and the APEC process is moving along very fine,&quot; conference chairman Federico Macaranas told a news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;We understand there are, of course, certain issues that have to be further discussed,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The United States proposed that Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum members should cut tariffs on information technology and related products to zero by the year 2000.</p>
<p>The proposal met a lukewarm response, irking U.S. delegates.</p>
<p>&quot;We had thought they would have seen this as a real opportunity to take hold and move forward,&quot; one official said.</p>
<p>Other APEC members said the U.S. proposal was too general and failed to detail specific product lines.</p>
<p>Macaranas said the issue of the lifting of a three-year moratorium on new members was deferred to the next meeting to be held in October in Manila.</p>
<p>The moratorium has been contentious within the trade grouping, with some members favouring the admission of new members while others saying APEC should consolidate itself before expanding further.</p>
<p>APEC's 18 members are Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand, Singapore, and the United States.</p>
<p>Ten countries have applied for membership.</p>
<p>The meeting was the third of its kind this year during which officials compiled individual action plans submitted by members into one blueprint to be submitted to APEC leaders when they meet in November.</p>
<p>The plan will elaborate on how APEC's goal of free trade within the region is to be met. The group has set a deadline of freeing trade between developed economies by 2010 and between poorer countries by 2020.</p>
<p>The senior officials' meeting in October will be the last this year after which they will prepare the &quot;Manila action plan&quot; that will be submitted to the leaders for approval.</p>
