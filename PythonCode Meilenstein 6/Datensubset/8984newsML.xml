<title>UK: NWE high sulphur fuel holds sharply higher.</title>
<headline>NWE high sulphur fuel holds sharply higher.</headline>

<p>High sulphur cargoes were significantly higher on Thursday on the back of tight avails and a deal done at $104.50 cif NWE.</p>
<p>On Wednesday a cargo was sold at $96 cif NWE.</p>
<p>Traders said the market was very finely balanced - an extra cargo or enquiry could shift the sector either way.</p>
<p>After the early trade high sulphur cargoes settled a touch lower around $103-105 cif NWE, but few dealers saw any enquiries for August material.</p>
<p>&quot;It is tight, but the tightness has been extenuated,&quot; said one trader who asked where the demand was now.</p>
<p>Utility end-user interest was not seen, although some dealers said they expected an increase for September material.</p>
<p>High sulphur barges gained but not with the same vigour as cargoes. Barges traded at $100 fob ARA several times and $100.50 was the peak, but prices slipped narrowly to $98-99. Barges were not particuarly active, dampened in part by slow bunkering.</p>
<p>Low sulphur cracked cargoes consolidated gains made earlier in the week, but no trade was heard. Demand in NWE was absent and cargo avails were restricted to &quot;bits and bobs,&quot; according to one broker.</p>
