<p>Peruvian guerrillas killed one man and took eight people hostage after taking over a village in the country's northeastern jungle region, anti- terrorist police sources said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>For three hours on Tuesday, around 100 members of the Maoist rebel group Shining Path took control of Alomella Robles, a small village about 345 miles (550 km) northeast of Lima, the sources said.</p>
<p>Some guerrillas made villagers listen to propaganda speeches in the village centre, others forced passing motorists out of their cars and daubed their vehicles with slogans.</p>
<p>By Wednesday, the whereabouts of the eight hostages was still not known, the sources said.</p>
<p>In recent months the Shining Path, severely weakened since the 1992 capture of its leader Abimael Guzman, has been stepping up both its military and propaganda activities.</p>
<p>Peru's guerrilla conflicts have cost at least 30,000 lives and $25 billion in damage to infrastructure since 1980.</p>
