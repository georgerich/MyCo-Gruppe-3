<p>The head of an international mediating mission in Chechnya on Thursday described living conditions for civilians holed up in shelters in Grozny as grave, with water, food and medical supplies in short supply.</p>
<p>Swiss diplomat Tim Guldimann, who leads the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) assistance group to the rebel Russian province, told reporters civilians sheltering in blocks of apartments for days were particularly hard hit.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a lack of drinking water, food and medical supplies and there is now almost no hospital functioning in Grozny. It is very difficult,&quot; Guldimann told a news briefing.</p>
<p>Families living in small houses on the outskirts of the city were able to emerge from cellars to collect drinking water following a bout of rainfall in the past few days and pick whatever vegetables were growing in their gardens, he said.</p>
<p>But humanitarian organisations needed to reach civilians sheltering in apartment blocks.</p>
<p>He was unable to say how many injured civilians were in dire need of medical attention in the city.</p>
<p>The Red Cross estimated on Wednesday that about 120,000 civilians remained in Grozny. A similar number had fled in the last two weeks.</p>
<p>Guldimann was speaking a day after four remaining OSCE staff pulled the mission out of Grozny to rebase in neighbouring Ingushetia following an ultimatum by Russia's acting commander in Chechnya on Monday to bomb Grozny if rebels did not withdraw from the city in 48 hours.</p>
<p>But no all-out assault took place as the deadline passed on Thursday while Russian President Boris Yeltsin's security chief, Alexander Lebed, flew into a Chechen village for talks with rebel leaders.</p>
<p>Lebed said he had halted the attack after last-minute talks with rebel leaders on Wednesday night.</p>
<p>The OSCE assistance group has led sporadic talks over the past year between Chechen separatists and Russian officials on ending the conflict, which has killed more than 30,000 people, mostly civiilans, since Moscow sent troops to the rebellious Caucausus region in December 1994.</p>
<p>Guldimann said, however, that communications between the OSCE mission and Moscow had been difficult over the past two weeks as he and his colleagues had spent most of their time taking cover in a cellar with only a satellite telephone powered by a car battery.</p>
