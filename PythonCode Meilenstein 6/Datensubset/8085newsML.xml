<p>Jordan delayed the start of the academic year for thousands of children across the kingdom by a week because of last weekend's bread riots, officials said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister of Education has announced on Thursday the delay of the start of the school year in the kingdom to Saturday 31 August from Saturday 24 August,&quot; a ministry of education official told Reuters.</p>
<p>The official said the decision was to allow the ministry &quot;to undertake the necessary maintenance to repair the damage to school buildings in some areas&quot;.</p>
<p>But other government officials said the move was a precaution to head off any trouble at schools. There are nearly 1.3 million students.</p>
<p>A few schools and the office of the education ministry for the southern city of Karak and surrounding villages were damaged by demonstrators who rioted after a government decision to double bread prices.</p>
