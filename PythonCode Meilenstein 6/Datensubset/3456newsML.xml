<p>Silver stood out as key commodities drifted lower overnight, pushing the CRB index 1.32 points down to 250.65.</p>
<p>Silver fixed at its highest level since June 19 in London on Tuesday morning following buying by speculators in New York.</p>
<p>The metal fixed at $5.2025 an ounce, up 12 cents from Monday's fix and eight cents above Monday's London close.</p>
<p>Silver closed in London at $5.23, up 12 cents.</p>
<p>METALS</p>
<p>Copper prices drifted lower in routine trade on the London Metal Exchange, weighed down by light Far Eastern selling, a rise in stocks and weakening nearby spreads. Other base metals were narrowly mixed at the end of another sluggish day.</p>
<p>Three month copper futures finished the afternoon kerb at $1,931 a tonne against Monday's afternoon close of $1,942.</p>
<p>Cash narrowed to a $40/45 premium over three month values from $57 on Monday. Analysts were not ruling out further losses in the short term as bearish sentiment prevailed.</p>
<p>&quot;In the short term we could see a test of $1,900 support, and $1,880 would need to hold below that,&quot; said William Adams of Rudolf Wolff. &quot;I don't think the market is looking particularly strong at the moment,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Copper stocks rose 5,000 tonnes, which was in line with market expectations, but underlined the strong rising trend in inventory levels.</p>
<p>&quot;Stocks may well get up towards 300,000 tonnes total (from 266,000 on Tuesday) by the end of the slow summer period, and that could encourage good lending,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>Aluminium finished marginally weaker at $1,489 from $1,490 having hit a low of $1,482. Stocks rose 2,900 tonnes.</p>
<p>Prices were trapped in a downward price channel and needed to break above $1,510 to escape to the upside.</p>
<p>Nickel prices finished on a strong note, gaining $65 to $7,185 despite dipping to $7,070 at one stage.</p>
<p>Routine buying emerged during the afternoon session after an increase in stocks of 114 tonnes pulled values back earlier on.</p>
<p>Traders said further deliveries into the LME could be expected over the next few weeks and months as off-warrant metal was put on warrant.</p>
<p>Zinc failed to react to a sizeable stockdraw, with traders comfortable with overall inventories while demand was subdued.</p>
<p>Stocks fell 4,050 tonnes but prices edged back $2 to $1,031.</p>
<p>&quot;At 8.5 weeks' (consumption) the current stocks ratio is an improvement on the 9.4 weeks' ruling at the end of 1995 but has some way to go still before a sustained rise is reflected in prices,&quot; said brokers Brandeis in a report.</p>
<p>Lead gained $3 to $824 while stocks rose 1,075 tonnes.</p>
<p>Gold closed in London at US$387.30/387.80.</p>
<p>GRAINS</p>
<p>CBOT wheat futures closed lower on diminished fears about frost damage to the Canadian wheat crop and on concern about prospects for sales of soft red winter wheat to Egypt.</p>
<p>Meteorologists cited a diminished possibility of frost next week in Canada's spring wheat areas.</p>
<p>The market was boosted Monday on concern about outlooks for freezing temperatures next week, the traders said.</p>
<p>Wheat closed two to five cents per bushel lower, with September down five at $4.54-1/2.</p>
<p>OIL</p>
<p>NYMEX crude and refined products futures closed lower on profit-taking Tuesday, amid expectations the latest weekly inventory report by the American Petroleum Institute would be disappointing for the gasoline market.</p>
<p>September crude oil fell 0.40 cents to $22.86 a barrel in its final NYMEX session while traders rolled over positions into the October contract which posted a similar drop of 0.36 cents. October closed at $22.11 a barrel.</p>
<p>Traders cited the the stable crude intermonth spread as bullish. &quot;Tommorow there will be a bounce,&quot; said a trader of the energy complex generally.</p>
<p>SUGAR</p>
<p>CSCE world sugar futures settled slightly higher on fund buying after a dull and lightly-traded session.</p>
<p>October settled 0.09 cent a lb firmer at 11.81, having ranged from 11.87 to 11.70.</p>
<p>LCE white sugar futures closed higher, with October gaining $1.50 on the day to end at $353.30. December settled up 70 cents to $346.50.  </p>
