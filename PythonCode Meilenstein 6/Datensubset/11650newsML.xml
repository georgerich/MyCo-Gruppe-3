<headline>LIFFE to change BTP contract terms from March 1997.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-08-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>LIFFE said on Friday it was changing the contract specifications of its BTP futures contract for delivery months from March 1997 onwards to adjust for an Italian withholding tax move.</p>
<p>LIFFE (the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange) said the invoice amount currently includes an adjustment for pro rata gross coupon interest as at Delivery Day, minus the amount of withholding tax.</p>
<p>&quot;For the March 1997 delivery months onwards...the adjustment will be made without any reduction of withholding tax,&quot; LIFFE said in a statement.  </p>
<p>&quot;The decision reflects the abolition of the withholding tax on Italian Government Bonds for non-residents and domestic corporations, which will be effective from January 1, 1997,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>&quot;The change has been made in consultation with members and market participants in order to reflect underlying cash market conditions,&quot; LIFFE said.</p>
<p>The exchange said the March 1997 delivery month was originally due to be listed on June 5, 1996 but was suspended to allow time to revise the contract specification. It will now be available for trading on 0700 GMT on August 22, LIFFE said.</p>
<p>For March 1997 onwards, LIFFE said there would be no reduction in withholding tax for BTPs which acrue interest gross in the cash market as at the Delivery Day.</p>
<p>For those bonds which accrue interest net in the cash market as at Delivery Day, the adjustment will continue to subtract the amount of withholding tax, a LIFFE official said.  </p>
