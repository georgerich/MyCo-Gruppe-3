<p>Transport group Koninklijke Nedlloyd Groep NV on Wednesday announced a first half drop in net profit from ordinary operations but said the overall performance in the half was boosted by a big extraordinary gain.</p>
<p>Shares in the company bounded higher, rising 2.00 guilders to 37.00 guilders in a weaker Amsterdam stock market, boosted by the company's forecast that it did not anticipate a loss from ordinary operations for the year.</p>
<p>&quot;The recovery of results in the ocean shipping sector strengthens the executive board in its confidence that we will not make a loss for the whole of 1996,&quot; the company said in a statement with results.</p>
<p>The unpredictability of market developments, especially in container shipping, made it impossible to make a precise forecast of 1996 results, it added.</p>
<p>Net profit from ordinary operations in the six months to June 30 slid to six million guilders from 38 million in the same period a year earlier.</p>
<p>A massive 273 million guilder extraordinary gain arising from the sale of a subsidiary and a 26 million guilder refund from its pension fund boosted total net profit to 276 million guilders from 96 million in the first half of last year.</p>
<p>Nedlloyd said it made a book profit of 247 million guilders on the sale of its offshore drilling unit Neddrill.</p>
<p>Analysts had expected a first half loss before extraordinaries of 15 to 35 million guilders.</p>
