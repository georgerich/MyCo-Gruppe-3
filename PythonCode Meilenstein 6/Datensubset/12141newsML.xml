<p>QUESTION OF THE WEEK - In the aftermath of this week's budget and the revised outlook on Australia to positive by Standard &amp; Poor's, economists were asked for their forecasts for the 10-year bond yield, the 10-year yield spread to the U.S., and the Australian dollar versus the U.S. at end-December.</p>
<p>Economists generally expect bond yields to retrace their steps slightly by year-end, but primarily on the back of a weakening U.S. Treasury market, which is seen facing tighter monetary policy amid a rebounding economy.</p>
<p>However, Australia's positive outlook on inflation, international confidence in the the country post-budget and S&amp;P's revised outlook, and the prospect of a further cut in official interest rates should see the local market's outperformance against the U.S. continue and see the yield spread compress further.</p>
<p>The 10-year bond yield touched its lowest level since March 1994 on Wednesday at just below 7.80 percent following the budget and S&amp;P's report, while the spread currently stands at around 125 basis points, its lowest level in over two years and half the level seen last April.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Australian dollar will be underpinned by a global economic rebound, stronger commodity prices and through demand for Australian debt for the reasons above.</p>
<p>However, the possibility of another rate cut and a further erosion of the yield diffential, particularly if the U.S. does tighten, could weigh on the currency.</p>
<p>The AUD was trading just over US$79 cents on Friday.</p>

<p>June Quarter stocks and net exports were largely reduced to irrelevance by the early release June quarter GDP data and few analysts bothered to forecast either.</p>
<p>NET FOREIGN DEBT</p>
<p>Net foreign debt is seen widening a little to around A$186 billion from A$184.8 in the March quarter as the monthly run of current account deficits are only partly compensated for by the appreciation of the A$ in the quarter -- that automatically reduces the nominal value of debt denominated in foreign currencies. The figure may reinforce some analysts suspicions that the level of debt may have finally plateaued in a A$180/185 bln range after more than doubling between 1986/87 and 1994/95.</p>
<p>CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT</p>
<p>The July's current account deficit looks like being close to June's surprisingly low A$1.29 billion thanks to an already reported three percent fall in merchandise imports in July. However, the net income deficit is something of an unknown since the ABS will have the first details from the June qtr Survey of Foreign Investment. These more up-to-date figures could also prompt a revision of past net income defcits.</p>
<p>RETAIL TRADE</p>
<p>Retail trade was seen recording a small gain in July in line with a flattening trend in recent months and only modest employment growth. Cuts in mortgage interest rates that month might have helped sentiment but borrowers' bills would not have reflected the easing for a month or so. Consumers might also have been intimidated by growing negative press speculation ahead of the August budget.</p>
<p>BUILDING APPROVALS</p>
<p>Building approvals should show a reasonable rise for July but only because June's 7.9 percent fall was far sharper than expected. The trend should remain flat to slightly negative and analysts see little prospect of a pickup until mortgage commitments show some sustained growth and the overhang of surplus property declines.</p>
