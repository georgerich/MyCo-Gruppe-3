<headline>Kellwood Q1 sales off due to lost volume.</headline>

<p>Kellwood Co said Thursday its sales for the first quarter ended July 31 declined four percent to $327.4 million from $340.6 million due to lost volume from operations that were closed or sold.</p>
<p>Volume was also lower from businesses that were consolidated and restructured in the second half of the last fiscal year.</p>
<p>It added that consumer demand for apparel remains relatively weak.</p>
<p>&quot;Kellwood has responded by taking a number of steps to improve our competitive position during a soft retail ennvironment,&quot; chairman William McKenna said in a statement. &quot;These steps include reducing overhead, more effective sourcing, and a better product mix.&quot;</p>
<p>He added that Kellwood, which makes and markets apparel, also has several programs and initiatives that are expected to show results in the fiscal third quarter.</p>
<p>&quot;As the second half of fiscal year 1997 unfolds, we should increasingly benefit from the refocused merchandising and sourcing strategies in the restructured business units,&quot; McKenna said.</p>
