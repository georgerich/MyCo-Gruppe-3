<p>Hurricane warnings were posted for parts of Mexico's northeast coast Thursday as Tropical Storm Dolly gained strength and again became a hurricane, the National Hurricane Center said.</p>
<p>At the same time, Tropical Storm Edouard gained little strength as it moved westward across the distant Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>At 1700 EDT/2100 EDT, Dolly's center was near latitude 20.6 north, longitude 94.6 west, or about 240 miles (386 km) east-southeast of Tampico, Mexico, and moving west-northwest near 10 mph (16 kmh).  </p>
<p>That motion was expected to continue during the next 24 hours, a track that would bring Dolly's center to the Mexican coast somewhere in the warned area on Friday morning. Hurricane warnings were posted from Veracruz to La Pesca on the northeast coast.</p>
<p>Maximum sustained winds were near 75 mph (121 kmh), making Dolly a weak Category One hurricane. Hurricane force winds extended up to 30 miles (48 km) from the storm's center, and tropical storm force winds extended outward up to 175 miles (282 km).</p>
<p>Tropical Storm Edouard continued to move westward across the Atlantic. At 5 p.m. EDT (2100 GMT), Edouard's center was near latitude 13.6 north, 35.1 west, or about (1,284 km) west of the Cape Verde Islands off Africa's coast, and moving west near 14 mph (23 kmh). That motion was expected to continue Friday, with some slight strengthening possible during the next 24 hours. forecasters said.</p>
