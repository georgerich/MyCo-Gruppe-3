<p>A visit to China by Japan's vice-defence minister has boosted military ties between the two countries and could pave the way for Beijing's defence minister to visit Tokyo next year, Japanese diplomats said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Naoaki Murata, Japan's Defence Agency's highest ranking career official, arrived in Beijing on Tuesday to resume high-level military talks between the two nations, the first such contact since 1989.</p>
<p>Murata met Chinese Defence Minister Chi Haotian on Thursday after touring a tank base near the Great Wall on the outskirts of Beijing on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;He had very significant and very frank talks with Mr Chi,&quot; a Japanese embassy official said. &quot;They talked about how to accelerate the bilateral relationship of the defence forces.</p>
<p>&quot;We consider this visit made the basis for the next step, maybe Mr Chi's visit to Japan, that could hopefully be held next year,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Japan suspended high-level defence contacts with China after the June 1989 military crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing's Tiananmen Square.</p>
<p>Murata briefed Chi on a Japan-U.S. security agreement that has caused concern in Beijing. He assured the Chinese minister that the April accord did not mark any change in Tokyo's military posture, the diplomat said.</p>
<p>Chi assured the Japanese visitors that China would keep to the nuclear test moratorium it declared in July, the diplomat said.</p>
<p>The two did not discuss a dispute between China and Japan over the disputed Diaoyu Islands, known in Japan as the Senkakus, that erupted last month, he said.</p>
<p>China on Wednesday accused Japan of trying to twist international law to gain ownership of the group of islands in the East China Sea. Last month, members of a Japanese right-wing group sailed to the islands and built a make-shift lighthouse on one of them.</p>
