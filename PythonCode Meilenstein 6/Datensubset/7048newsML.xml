<p>Organisers of the Miss Universe pageant on Tuesday denied they had ordered their reigning beauty queen, Venezuela's Alicia Machado, to shed pounds or else give up her title.</p>
<p>&quot;We are distressed about the recent reports that the Miss Universe organisation has put Alicia Machado on notice that she must lose weight in order to retain her title as Miss Universe,&quot; said Martin Brooks, president of Los Angeles-based Miss Universe Inc.</p>
<p>Brooks, in a statement released in the resort town of Las Cruces where Machado is attending the Miss Teen USA beauty pageant, said Miss Universe officials were &quot;extremely happy with Alicia and feel she fulfils her obligations ... exceptionally well.&quot;</p>
<p>In an unusual development, officials of the Miss Venezuela Organisation said on Monday in Caracas that the 19-year-old Machado had been given an ultimatum by Miss Universe organisers to lose 27 pounds (12 kg) in two weeks or risk losing the title.</p>
<p>At 5 feet 7 inches (1.73 meters) tall, Machado weighed 112 pounds (51 kg) in Las Vegas in May when she became the fourth Venezuelan to win the crown. She gained weight after the pageant because of what people close to her described as difficulty sticking to her diet and a weakness for pasta and cake.</p>
<p>In Venezuela -- a country proud of its reputation as the world's beauty queen capital -- reports that Machado's weight gain could endanger her crown made front-page news.</p>
<p>But on Tuesday Venezuelan pageant officials backed away from their earlier comments, with one official telling Reuters: &quot;She obviously has a weight problem which affects her swimsuit contracts but this does not mean she will be stripped of her crown.&quot;</p>
<p>Brooks emphasised on Tuesday that &quot;a weight requirement is not part of our titleholder employment contract.&quot;</p>
<p>Machado was scheduled to make a public appearance during the 1996 Miss Teen USA Pageant, which was to be held on Wednesday night at New Mexico State University and broadcast nationwide by CBS television.</p>
<p>Teen pageant officials maintained that Machado was there as the pageant's special guest, not to shed pounds.</p>
<p>Machado appeared with Las Cruces Mayor Ruben Smith on a morning talk show on local television station KVIA, but the subject of her weight did not come up.</p>
<p>&quot;Being with her this morning for a couple of hours I can tell you she looked in beautiful shape to me,&quot; Smith later told Reuters.</p>
<p>Asked if Machado was overweight, Wendy Schwartz, a Miss Universe publicist accompanying the beauty queen, said, &quot;I suggest people tune in to the show tomorrow night and they can decide for themselves.&quot;</p>
<p>After she was awarded the title in May, Machado told reporters in Las Vegas she planned to do &quot;something I haven't been able to do in three weeks: eat, eat, eat and sleep.&quot;</p>
<p>As word of Machado's weight problem spread, journalists from around the United States and Latin America descended on Las Cruces and swamped the teen pageant's public relations office with requests to cover the event.</p>
