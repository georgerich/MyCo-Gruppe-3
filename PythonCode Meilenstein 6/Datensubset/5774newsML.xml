<p>European vegetable oil prices were little changed at the close of business on Wednesday despite higher Chicago futures, traders said.</p>
<p>Chicago futures opened higher on reports of delayed development of the soybean crop but European traders were unimpressed.</p>
<p>&quot;We all know Chicago will remain volatile right up until the crop is in the silos, but people over here see no reason to follow every move the U.S. market makes,&quot; said a trader.</p>
<p>Dutch soy oil closed unchanged after Sep traded at 94.50 guilders a 100 kilos fob ex-mill.</p>
<p>Dutch/EU rape oil finished unchanged to 0.50 guilders lower with no business reported.</p>
<p>Palm oil prices were supported by higher prices in the Far East following a tender by India for palm olein.</p>
<p>India was seeking 6,000 tonnes of palm olein for September 5-20 shipment.</p>
<p>The higher Chicago opening had little impact and crude palm oil closed $5 to $2.50 up after Aug and Jan/Mar traded at $530 a tonne cif.</p>
<p>Palm products closed $5 up to unchanged with no further business reported.</p>
<p>Coconut oil was mixed with sellers $10 up to $15 down while palmkernel oil was $10 up to unchanged in tradeless markets.</p>
