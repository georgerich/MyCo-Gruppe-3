<p>Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan on Wednesday compared Turkey's Kurdish conflict with the Vietnam war but said the Turkish army was avoiding the fate of U.S. troops defeated by Vietnamese guerrillas forces.</p>
<p>&quot;In Vietnam, America lost a war against terrorism, or what we call guerrilla warfare. The mountainous regions of tiny Vietnam are not as great as ours. (The United States) lost, it couldn't succeed. But thankfully our army has prevented that happening,&quot; Erbakan told a news conference.</p>
<p>Turkish forces have been fighting Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) guerrillas for 12 years in a bitter campaign in the mountains of southeast Turkey. More than 20,000 people have died in the insurgency, with no end in sight.</p>
<p>&quot;Our heroic army has for years had great success against terrorism, a success not seen anywhere else in the world,&quot; Erbakan said.</p>
<p>The PKK, fighting for Kurdish autonomy or independence, has defied frequent predictions by government and military officials that it was close to defeat. It has used a power vaccum in Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq to establish forces there in recent years.</p>
<p>Erbakan, an Islamist, said that attacks from PKK units in neighbouring countries were standing in the way of the security forces finishing off the rebels.</p>
<p>&quot;Terrorism is not finished here because our borders are leaky,&quot; he said. Ankara accuses Syria of sponsoring the rebels and military officials have said the guerrillas often strike from across the rugged Iranian border.</p>
<p>Erbakan efectively killed off a peace bid by one of his Welfare Party MPs and an Islamist writer earlier this month when he ruled out direct talks with the PKK.</p>
<p>The military and Erbakan's conservative coalition partners strongly oppose negotiations to end the fighting.</p>
