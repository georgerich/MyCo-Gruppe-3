<p>U.S. rail freight traffic in the latest week increased from a year ago as trailer and container volume seems to be recovering from a lengthy slump, a railroad group said Thursday.</p>
<p>Association of American Railroads (AAR) said new trailer and container traffic in the week ended Aug 17 totaled 161,846 cars, up 5.3 percent from 153,702 in the same week last year.  </p>
<p>AAR chief economist Harvey Levine said traffic in trailer and container cars &quot;went into a slump beginning in the second quarter last year, and it now appears as if that slump may be ending.&quot;</p>
<p>The number of new carloadings of various commodities totaled 354,341, up 1.4 percent from 349,468 in the year-ago week.</p>
<p>New lumber and wood product carloadings in the latest week totalled 5,586, up 5.7 percent from a year ago, while carloadings of motor vehicles and parts totaled 19,576, up 13.7 percent from a year ago.  </p>
<p>New carloadings of metals and products totaled 12,477 in the current week, up nine percent from a year ago, coal carloadings totaled 140,894, up 9.3 percent, but grain carloadings at 19,879 in the week slid 26.4 percent.</p>
<p>The number of ton-miles on major railroads was 26.4 billion in the latest week, up 3.1 percent from a year ago. A ton-mile equals one ton of freight hauled one mile.</p>
<p>So far this year, the AAR said ton-miles rose 2.5 percent from the same period last year, trailer and container traffic was up 0.1, but traffic in carloadings fell 0.7 percent.</p>
<p>The AAR also announced it no longer includes freight traffic for U.S. subsidiaries of Canadian railroads in the U.S. traffic totals.</p>
