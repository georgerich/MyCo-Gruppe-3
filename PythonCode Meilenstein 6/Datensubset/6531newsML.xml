<p>Guilder bonds headed deeper into negative territory during late Wednesday trade, closing the session well down in line with bunds after Germany published stronger-than-expected July IFO data.</p>
<p>Dealers said they expected the market to remain nervy in early Thursday trade ahead of the Bundesbank council meeting, but said the market was already showing signs of bottoming out.</p>
<p>&quot;A slight economic recovery in the second half has been expected since early February and now the figures are here there's suddenly a big reaction.&quot;  </p>
<p>A surge to 94.1 in Germany's July business climate index from 90.4 in June -- well above the market forecast of 91.0 -- severely dampened hopes of a cut in Germany's repo rate when the Bundesbank meets tomorrow.</p>
<p>Some dealers predicted that a Bundesbank cut, if it came at all, would be limited to shaving two to five basis points off the current 3.30 percent rate.</p>
<p>Dealers said much of the day's activity had been centered on the new Dutch 5.75 percent September 2002 tap issue, which was quoted well down on its official 100.15 price the entire session.  </p>
<p>The new September 2002 state bond closed the day at 99.67/75, for a bid yield of 5.82. Consequently the issue raised no new funds for the treasury. &quot;We've done nothing today,&quot; a finance ministry spokesman said.</p>
<p>Dealers said the tap price had been pressured by market expectations of a longer-date issue. &quot;The market had been expecting a 2006 issue, and this has depressed the price,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>There had been some swapping out of other 2002s to buy the new issue, another dealer said. Dealers also reported swapping out of Dutch 10-year into equivalent German paper.  </p>
