<p>Swiss leaders on Tuesday rejected calls to hold the country's frequent national referendums on the Internet, saying computer networks were vulnerable to sabotage.</p>
<p>The Federal Council, or cabinet, dismissed a parliamentary request for a study of ways for Swiss voters to cast their ballots electronically over the world-wide computer network.</p>
<p>Internet voting would be too vulnerable to manipulation by computer hackers, since the Internet is accessible from almost any computer, the cabinet said.</p>
<p>&quot;This danger is much greater in a computer network, and especially in the Internet, than under current voting methods,&quot; it said, referring to the ballot papers and boxes now in use.</p>
<p>Internet voting would also require enormous investment in technology to make it available to all, the cabinet added.</p>
<p>Six members of parliament had urged the government to look into Internet balloting as a way of luring non-voting Swiss, especially younger people, back into the democratic process.</p>
<p>Voter turnout has fallen gradually for years at the same time as the number of referendums has mushroomed under Switzerland's system of direct democracy.</p>
<p>Swiss citizens are able to vote directly on many major policy issues rather than delegating them to elected representatives, as happens in most other democracies.</p>
<p>A given year might see five to 10 national referendums and even more local ones.</p>
