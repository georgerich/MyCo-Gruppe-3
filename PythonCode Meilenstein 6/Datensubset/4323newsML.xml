<title>NETHERLANDS: European bunkers up again, trade generally slack.</title>
<headline>European bunkers up again, trade generally slack.</headline>
<dateline>AMSTERDAM 1996-08-20</dateline>

<p>European bunkers firmed on Tuesday as fuel oil barge prices rose and after Monday's late futures surge, dealers said.</p>
<p>A feeling that prices would soon weaken left most business slack, particularly in the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Rotterdam 380 CST fuel oil was at $99/$100 fob. Fuel oil barges traded as high as $99 fob ARA. Dealers said bunker demand was a reasonable 10-15,000 tonnes. A number of buyers covered early as prices began to rise but were dormant in the afternoon, believing futures' weakness would lead bunker prices lower.</p>
<p>Hamburg prices rose in line with Rotterdam, but quoted levels were barely tested.</p>
<p>In the Mediterranean, prices firmed sharply. The many enquiries did not amount to a large volume of demand, as most buyers were only interested in small quantities to cover essential requirements. Dealers in Piraeus reported no new demand until Thursday.</p>
<p>Durban prices were reported firming as shortages continued to afflict the market. Dealers said supply should increase by late August.</p>
