<p>Tokyo stocks ended higher for the third straight day on Wednesday, relieved by the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to leave interest rates steady.</p>
<p>But brokers said the market lacked energy to test higher levels.</p>
<p>The key 225-share Nikkei average closed up 148.01 points or 0.70 percent at 21,275.02, off a high of 21,391.00 set earlier in the day. Its September futures gained 80 points to 21,260.</p>
<p>&quot;One of the drags on the market has disappeared,&quot; said Haruo Nakaharu,a  strategist at Toyo Securities Co Ltd. He was referring to Tuesday's Federal Open Market Committee meeting.  </p>
<p>Gainers were led by iron/steel, fisheries, sea transport, banks and pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p>The key retreating sectors were warehouses, electric power, services and credit/lease.</p>
<p>Brokers said no individual issues led today's rally.</p>
<p>Blue-chip Fuji Photo Film Co Ltd gained 150 yen to close at 3,450.</p>
<p>Matsushita-Kotobuki Electronics Industries Ltd advanced 160 yen to end at 2,760, after the company raised its earnings forecast on Tuesday.</p>
