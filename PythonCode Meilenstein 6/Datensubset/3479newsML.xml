<p>Australian Greens senators Bob Brown and Dee Margetts said on Tuesday they wanted to emulate in 1996 the results achieved by the minor parties in the Senate after the 1993 budget.  </p>
<p>&quot;Because the Greens stood up to (Labor Prime Minister) Paul Keating (in 1993) there was something like A$100 million extra came out for those most vulnerable people at the bottom end of the income scale in Australia,&quot; Brown told reporters after the delivery of the 1996/97 federal budget.</p>
<p>&quot;I would dearly love to be able to start my career in the senate for the Australian Greens in emulating that fantastic result that the two Greens delivered in Australia in terms of social justice back in 1993,&quot; Brown said.  </p>
<p>&quot;It's not a matter of delaying the budget, it's a matter of allowing a full and proper public debate,&quot; Brown said.</p>
<p>In 1993 the Australian dollar and bond markets were sold down sharply when Green and other independent senators held up passage of some budget bills for over a month.</p>
<p>Brown, Margetts, the left-leaning Democrats and independent Brian Harradine can block legislation put forward by the governing Liberal/National coalition when voting with the opposition Labor party.  </p>
<p>The Greens, the Democrats and Labor have said they would not block the appropriations bills, which effectively gives the government the money needed to spend on day-to-day affairs.</p>
<p>The government would have to shut down eventually without these bills.</p>
<p>&quot;Those areas where we are required to make a decision, personally I take that very seriously and make sure that by the time I am required to make a decision I have the best information upon which to do that,&quot; Margetts said.</p>
<p>New revenue measures often require separate legislation which would have to pass the Senate.  </p>
<p>Treasurer Peter Costello said earlier on Tuesday that there were some measures in the budget which could be knocked back by the Senate.</p>
<p>Costello delivered a budget projecting an underlying deficit of A$5.65 billion in the year to June 30, 1997, including A$3.9 billion of deficit cuts.</p>
<p>Labor Treasury spokesman Gareth Evans earlier said Labor would vote against a hike in fees for university students.</p>
<p>The increased Higher Education Contribution Scheme (HECS) charges were projected to save A$1.77 billion over the next four years.    -- Canberra bureau 61-6 273-2730</p>
