<p>Colombian stocks ended mixed in dull trading, with most attention focused on the auction of controlling interest in bankrupt cement manufacturer Industrias e Inversiones Samper after the session's close.</p>
<p>Medellin's IBOMED general price index dropped 0.23 percent to end at 13,255.65 on a much lower-than-average volume of 460.2 million pesos. Bogota's IBB rose a miniscule 0.08 percent, meanwhile, closing at 843.08 on a healthier volume of 2.5 billion pesos.</p>
<p>Banco Ganadero, the country's largest bank in terms of assets, was among the few winners in Bogota.  </p>
<p>A 40 percent stake in the bank will be sold to Spain's Banco Bilbao Vizcaya next week, and brokers said its common shares rose 0.53 percent in Tuesday's trade to close at 284 pesos per share. Ganadero's preferential shares also closed higher, ending up 0.45 percent at 223 pesos.</p>
<p>Construcel, a thinly-traded engineering firm, was the day's biggest winner. Brokers said it closed up 9.6 percent at 250 pesos per share on a huge cross-trade involving 2.3 million pesos of shares.</p>
<p>Losers in Medellin included Banco Ganadero, which saw its common shares drop 0.35 percent to end at 282 pesos.  </p>
<p>Brewer Bavaria SA also extended its recent losses in Medellin, ending down 1.38 percent at 3,550 pesos per share.</p>
<p>Brokerage Corredores Asociados SA snapped up all 275 million shares in Industrias e Inversiones Samper at auction late Tuesday.</p>
<p>The deal was the focus of attention on the Bogota exchange all day, but it was not immediately clear who the buyer was.</p>
<p>Traders and company spokesmen would only say that the anonymous buyer, widely belived to be Mexico's Cemex, paid $1.08 per share.</p>
