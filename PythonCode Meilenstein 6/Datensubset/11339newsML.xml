<headline>Kurd group says attacked by Iraqi artillery.</headline>

<p>An Iraqi Kurdish guerrilla group engaged in bloody clashes with a rival Kurd militia on Friday accused Baghdad's forces of shelling its positions in northern Iraq, the official Iranian news agency IRNA said.</p>
<p>It quoted a radio station run by the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) as saying Iraqi heavy artillery was pounding its positions in Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq.</p>
<p>The radio gave no details about possible casualties, the agency added.</p>
<p>There was no independent confirmation of the report.</p>
<p>The rival Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), which accuses Iran of supporting the PUK, said on Thursday that its forces had halted an Iranian-backed attack by thousands of PUK fighters.</p>
<p>It said around 400 PUK guerrillas were killed, wounded or taken prisoner. The PUK was not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>The KDP has accused neighbour Iran of laying down artillery barrages in support of the PUK and allowing it to use Iranian territory. The PUK denies backing from Tehran. Tehran has not reacted to the charges.</p>
<p>The clashes are taking place in a Kurdish enclave protected from Baghdad by a U.S.-led air force based in southern Turkey since shortly after the 1991 Gulf War.</p>
<p>Washington has urged the rival Kurdish parties to stop fighting and accept a U.S. invitation to peace talks in London.</p>
<p>Northern Iraq has been split into rival Kurdish zones since fighting broke out between the two groups in 1994. Around 3,000 people died until a ceasefire was arranged in March 1995.</p>
