<p>Tokyo stock prices were mixed in early morning trade on Tuesday, with the market's benchmark Nikkei average continuing on the rebound path it started on Monday.</p>
<p>Gains were likely to be limited, brokers said, as market activity was still fairly thin although the peak week for Japanese corporations' summer vacations was over.</p>
<p>At 0019 GMT, the 225-share Nikkei average was up 44.21 points or 0.21 percent at 21,150.62. In the futures market, however, the key September futures, were down 50 points at 21,120.</p>
<p>&quot;The Nikkei will probably try for the 21,207 level, which is one-third of the way up from its (recent) lows, and after that it may eye the 21,400 to 21,500 level,&quot; one broker added.</p>
