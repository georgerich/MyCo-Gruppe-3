<p>President Boris Yeltsin's former personal bodyguard and confidant General Alexander Korzhakov said in an interview published on Wednesday he had been shocked by what he called abuse of power by top Russian officials.</p>
<p>Korzhakov, sacked by Yeltsin in June after a Kremlin power struggle, told the weekly Argumenty i Fakty that he had fallen victim to his own anti-corruption crusade in the Kremlin.</p>
<p>&quot;One could get the impression that nearly all top officials are working to loot state property,&quot; said Korzhakov, former head of the president's powerful security service.</p>
<p>He told Argumenty i Fakty that dozens of corrupt Kremlin officials had been demoted after his reports, but blamed faulty legislation for the fact that many officials had escaped trial.</p>
<p>&quot;Frankly speaking I could never dream of seeing these people behind bars -- dismissal would be enough,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Korzhakov, a shadowy figure whom many saw as Yeltsin's main confidant during much of his first term in office, had been Yeltsin's security officer for more than a decade.</p>
<p>He joined the president when Yeltsin moved to Moscow to head the local Communist Party and stayed with Yeltsin after he was expelled from the Soviet Communist Party leadership in 1987 for demanding a radical reform of the system.</p>
<p>Korzhakov's power grew after Yeltsin became Russia's first president and his well-equipped GUO security service, originally created to guarantee security for top state officials, competed in power and influence with the Federal Security Service (FSB).</p>
<p>But he and FSB head Mikhail Barsukov both fell from grace in a purge of hawkish hardliners between the two rounds of the Russian presidential election.</p>
<p>Korzhakov's men had seized two officials from Yeltsin's campaign team and interrogated them for several hours, placing the bodyguard in direct confrontation with top campaign official Anatoly Chubais.</p>
<p>Chubais, who once masterminded Russia's privatisation campaign, is now the president's chief of staff.</p>
<p>&quot;I was dumped for my curiosity,&quot; Korzhakov said. He said that the new Kremlin team had already started dismantling the system he had erected to keep Kremlin corruption under control.</p>
<p>&quot;After my resignation they have started dispersing the service,&quot; he said. &quot;They are trying hard to isolate people with exclusive information from each other or even to sack them.&quot;</p>
<p>Korzhakov said he believed that Yeltsin was in charge of Russia but that he was heavily &quot;assisted&quot;. He made clear that this help came from Chubais.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Chubais...has become a regent to the live president and his utmost worry now is to set up his own regency in the Kremlin,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, 65, has not been seen in public since he was inaugurated for a second term on August 9, but aides have denied a flurry of media reports that he is ill.</p>
<p>They say the president is taking a short break in the northwestern lakeland of Valdai and will decide whether to take a more extended holiday there.</p>
