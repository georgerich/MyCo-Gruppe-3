<p>South Africa has big potential to increase sugar production and keep annual exports at over a million tonnes, the executive director of the International Sugar Organisation said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;After four years of drought and bad crops, South Africa is back again. One million tonnes of (sugar) exports puts South Africa in the premier league,&quot; Peter Baron told Reuters in the Indian Ocean port city of Durban.  </p>
<p>&quot;In the future South Africa will be exporting around a million tonnes or even more. I think this will be a permanent pattern because the potential, technology and knowledge are here,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;South Africa has big potential to increase production but this should only be done in line with an expanding market,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>He said South African production for 1995/96 (October- September) was estimated at 2.4 million tonnes, of which about one milllion tonnes would be exported.  </p>
<p>Baron, on his first official visit to the country, said South Africa should concentrate on exporting to Middle Eastern and African countries which had high market potential.</p>
<p>He repeated comments made earlier this month that an estimated 5.5 million tonne surplus on international markets during 1995/96 should put a downward pressure on sugar prices.</p>
<p>Among the countries which had contributed to the surplus were Brazil, Thailand, Australia, India and South Africa.</p>
<p>He said it was possible that the Indian government might licence the sale of part of its large sugar stocks in addition to the one million tonnes it was already exporting.  </p>
<p>&quot;I wouldn't be surprised if the Indian government does licence another few hundred thousand tonnes of sugar for export,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>An important market being watched was China, which imports about 1.5 million tonnes annually, which will probably increase the future, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;China, for the coming years, will be a considerable importer and will import one to two million tonnes a year over the next five or six years.&quot;  </p>
<p>Baron said the two new mills in the Middle East would increase their demand for raw sugar and limit imports of refined sugar from the European Union (EU).</p>
<p>&quot;Since the EU is not a raw exporter it will struggle to find alternative markets,&quot; he said, adding new markets for the EU could be found in Eastern Europe which was a large importer, in some instances importing as much sugar as China.</p>
<p>He said recent moves in Russia to establish a private sugar association would &quot;have a very positive effect on the Russian economy.&quot;</p>
