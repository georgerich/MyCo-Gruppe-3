<title>AUSTRALIA: RTRS-Westpac Australia leading index down in June.</title>
<headline>RTRS-Westpac Australia leading index down in June.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1996-08-21</dateline>

<p>The Westpac-Melbourne Institute Leading Index of economic activity, which indicates where activity will be in six to nine months time, fell by 1.1 points or 0.8 percent in June 1996.</p>
<p>The annual growth rate of the index was minus 0.6 percent.</p>
<p>The coincident index, which provides a broad measure of the current state of economic activity, posted a rise of 1.4 points or 0.8 percent in June, leaving the annual growth rate postive at 3.9 percent.</p>
<p>The leading index of inflation fell again by 0.5 percentage points from 5.0 percent in May to 4.5 percent in June.  </p>
<p>&quot;The fall in the leading index in June indicates little chance of a lift in activity in the second half of the year and indeed we should expect further slowing in economic activity in the coming months,&quot; Westpac general manager, economics, Bill Evans said in a statement.</p>
<p>Westpac expects the next upswing in economic activity to begin towards mid-1997.</p>
<p>Evans also said the apparent strength in the coincident index is influenced unduly by the unusally high March quarter GDP rise of 2.0 percent, but when June quarter's flat growth of 0.1 percent is factored in, the index will look markedly weaker.  </p>
<p>On the inflation index, Evans said it points to a continuing deceleration in inflation in 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;The combination of a soft forward outlook for activity and continuing moderation in inflationary pressures provide the pre-conditions for the Reserve Bank to be contemplating a further interest rate cut in the near term,&quot; Evans said.</p>
<p>&quot;The fiscal tightening announced in yesterday's budget will also add to the case for an easing. The budget has been well recieved by markets, which are partially factoring in a 50 basis point easing in the cash rate to 6.5 percent, with some expectation of a bigger cut,&quot; he added.  </p>
<p>The Liberal-National government on Tuesday announced savings of A$7.2 billion, starting with A$3.9 billion in 1996/97, in its 1996/97 budget and reduced the underlying budget deficit to A$5.65 billion from A$10.3 billion in 1995/96.</p>
