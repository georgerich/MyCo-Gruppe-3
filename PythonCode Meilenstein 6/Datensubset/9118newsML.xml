<p>President Boris Yeltsin, in a statement marking the fifth anniversary of the failed hardline coup against Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, described the Chechen crisis as a &quot;bleeding wound&quot; on the body of Russia.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, congratulating his fellow citizens on crushing the August 1991 coup, said life was difficult for many Russians in other former Soviet republics. But democracy was making headway at home and Russia's statehood had been strengthened.</p>
<p>&quot;Life is still complicated for a significant number of Russians, the process of economic transformation is progressing with difficulty,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Chechen crisis is a bleeding wound on Russia's body, carrying away the lives of our citizens. The fate of our countrymen elsewhere in the Commonwealth of Independent States is not easy.&quot;</p>
<p>Gorbachev, who withdrew Soviet forces from Afghanistan, also described the war there as a &quot;bleeding wound&quot;.</p>
<p>Yeltsin sent troops to Chechnya in December 1994 to crush an independence bid and tens of thousands of people have been killed in the fighting. His security chief Alexander Lebed is in the region in the latest of many attempts to end the crisis.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, who returned to Moscow on Thursday after a two-day break in the lakelands of northwestern Russia, was shown briefly on television meeting new health minister Tatyana Dmitrieva.</p>
<p>It was Yeltsin's first television appearance since he was inaugurated for a second term in office on August 9, and he looked stiff and awkward on that occasion.</p>
<p>His disappearance had prompted speculation in Russian and Western media that Yeltsin was ill, but aides said he was simply tired after a gruelling campaign for reelection.</p>
<p>Yeltsin led resistance to the 1991 coup, climbing on top of a tank outside the White House government building to denounce the plotters who said Gorbachev was ill and declared a state of emergency across the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, who met several new ministers in the Kremlin on Thursday, also drew attention to what he described as Russia's victory over inflation in the years since the coup. &quot;Inflation has been beaten,&quot; he said triumphantly.</p>
<p>Russian consumer prices fell 0.1 percent in the week to August 19, the first time that prices have fallen since economic reforms began.</p>
