<p>A Hamburg court sentenced U.S. neo-Nazi leader Gary Lauck on Thursday to four years in prison for pumping banned extremist propaganda into Germany from his base in the United States.</p>
<p>Lauck, from Lincoln, Nebraska, yelled a tirade of abuse at the court after his conviction for inciting racial hatred.</p>
<p>&quot;The struggle will go on,&quot; the 43-year-old shouted in German before being escorted out by security guards.</p>
<p>Lauck's lawyer vowed he would appeal against the court's decision, arguing that his client should have been set free because he had not committed any offence under German law.</p>
<p>The German government hailed the conviction as a major victory in the fight against neo-Nazism. Lauck's worldwide network has been the main source of anti-Semitic propaganda material flowing into Germany since the 1970s.</p>
<p>&quot;Lauck possessed a well-oiled propaganda machine, honed during more than 20 years,&quot; presiding judge Guenter Bertram told the court.</p>
<p>&quot;He set up a propaganda cannon and fired it at Germany.&quot; said Bertram, who also read out extracts from Lauck's material praising Hitler as &quot;the greatest of all leaders&quot; and describing the Nazi slaughter of millions of Jews as a myth.</p>
<p>Eager to put Lauck behind bars quickly and avoid a long and complex trial, prosecutor Bernd Mauruschat limited his charges to offences since 1994. He had demanded a five-year jail term but said he was satisfied with the court's sentence.</p>
<p>Publishing and distributing neo-Nazi material is illegal in Germany but Lauck's defence team had argued that U.S freedom of speech laws meant he was free to produce his swastika-covered books, magazines, videos and flags in his homeland.</p>
<p>Interior Minister Manfred Kanther said in a statement he &quot;welcomed the prosecution and conviction of one of the ringleaders of international neo-Nazism and biggest distributers of vicious racist publications&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;It is high time he was behind bars,&quot; the opposition Social Democrats said in a statement.</p>
<p>Lauck, dressed in a sober blue suit and sporting his trademark Hitleresque black moustache, showed no sign of emotion as Bertram spent more than an hour reading out the verdict and explaining the court's decision.</p>
<p>But as Lauck was about to be led away, he turned to reporters and blurted out a virtually incomprehensible quick-fire diatribe against the court.</p>
<p>&quot;Neither the National Socialists (Nazis) nor the communists dared to kidnap an American citizen,&quot; he shouted, in an oblique reference to his extradition to Germany from Denmark. &quot;That's the truth.&quot;</p>
<p>His attorney, Hans-Otto Sieg, told reporters outside the courtroom that the judges had not explained how a German court could judge someone for actions carried out in the United States.</p>
<p>Bertram said Lauck was obsessed by Nazism and devoted his life to leading his National Socialist German Workers' Party Foreign Organisation (NSDAP-AO), which derives its name from the full German title of Hitler's Nazi party.</p>
<p>During the three-month trial, the court dealt mainly with issues of the NSDAP-AO's &quot;NS Kampfruf&quot; (&quot;National Socialist Battle Cry&quot;) magazine, filled with references to Aryan supremacy and defamatory statements about Jews.</p>
<p>The court rejected Sieg's argument that Lauck's extradition from Denmark, where he was arrested in March last year at the request of German authorities, was illegal.</p>
<p>Lauck was also convicted of disseminating the symbols of anti-constitutional organisations.</p>
<p>He will probably be free in around two and a half years. The court ruled that the 15 months he has spent in custody since his arrest should be subtracted from his prison term.</p>
