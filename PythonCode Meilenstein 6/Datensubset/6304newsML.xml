<p>Israel and Syria have accused each other of raising tensions to a dangerous pitch but both sides are trying to calm the other's war fears.</p>
<p>Israel on Wednesday sent Syria a message, via Washington, saying it was committed to peace and wanted to open negotiations without preconditions. But it slammed Damascus for creating what it called a dangerous atmosphere.</p>
<p>Syria accused Israel on Wednesday of launching a hysterical campaign against it after Israeli television reported that Damascus had recently test fired a missile. It said its arms purchases were for defensive purposes.</p>
<p>&quot;The message that we sent to (Syrian President Hafez al-) Assad is that Israel is ready at any time without preconditions to enter peace negotiations,&quot; Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy told Israel Radio in an interview.</p>
<p>Tension has mounted since Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took office in June vowing to retain the Golan Heights Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war.</p>
<p>Israeli-Syrian peace talks have been deadlocked over the Golan since 1991 despite the previous government's willingness to make Golan concessions. Peace talks between the two sides were last held in February.</p>
<p>&quot;The voices coming out of Damascus are bad, not good. The media...are full of expressions and declarations that must be worrying...this artificial atmosphere is very dangerous because those who spread it could become its prisoners,&quot; Levy said.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect from Syria, if its face is to peace, that it will answer Israel's message to enter peace negotiations because that is our goal,&quot; he said. &quot;We do not want a war, God forbid. No one benefits from wars.&quot;</p>
<p>Israel's Channel Two television said Damascus had sent a &quot;calming signal&quot; to Israel. It gave no source for the report. Netanyahu and Levy's spokesmen said they could not confirm it.</p>
<p>The television also said that Netanyahu had sent messages to reassure Syria via Cairo, the United States and Moscow.</p>
<p>Syria accused Israel on Wednesday of launching a hysterical campaign against it after Israel's Channel Two reported on Monday that Damascus had recently test fired a Scud C missile able to hit most cities in the Jewish state.</p>
<p>Israel on Tuesday tested its U.S.-funded Arrow 2 missile, saying it successfully intercepted a target missile.</p>
<p>&quot;Suddenly a hysterical campaign is launched against Syria and its defence capabilities with the participation of Netanyahu, his generals and his media networks,&quot; the ruling party al-Baath newspaper said.</p>
<p>It said Netanyahu was &quot;using any pretext to escalate tension in the region to the maximum&quot;.</p>
<p>The official daily Tishreen said Israel should have its nuclear installations inspected because they were a threat to regional security.</p>
<p>&quot;The failure of taking serious and effective measures against Israel's nuclear armament will encourage large scale armament in the Middle East because Israel cannot grant itself this advantage and raise hell if an Arab country dares buy defensive weapons,&quot; Tishreen said.</p>
<p>Israeli opposition Labour party legislator Hagai Merom said on Wednesday Israeli intelligence agencies were concerned that Syria may opt for war to break a deadlock in peace talks.</p>
<p>Defence Minister Yitzhak Mordechai later issued a statement saying Merom's comments were &quot;not authorised, accurate nor responsible&quot;. Mordechai said Israel had no interest in escalation and would continue the search for peace.</p>
