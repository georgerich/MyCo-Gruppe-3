<p>China on Thursday accused Taipei of spoiling the atmosphere for a resumption of talks across the Taiwan Strait with a visit to Ukraine by Taiwanese Vice President Lien Chan this week that infuriated Beijing.</p>
<p>Speaking only hours after Chinese state media said the time was right to engage in political talks with Taiwan, Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang told Reuters: &quot;The necessary atmosphere for the opening of the talks has been disrupted by the Taiwan authorities.&quot;  </p>
<p>State media quoted China's top negotiator with Taipei, Tang Shubei, as telling a visiting group from Taiwan on Wednesday that it was time for the rivals to hold political talks.</p>
<p>&quot;Now is the time for the two sides to engage in political talks...that is to end the state of hostility,&quot; Thursday's overseas edition of the People's Daily quoted Tang as saying.</p>
<p>The foreign ministry's Shen told Reuters Television in an interview he had read reports of Tang's comments but gave no details of why the negotiator had considered the time right for talks with Taiwan, which Beijing considers a renegade province.</p>
<p>China, which has long opposed all Taipei efforts to gain greater international recognition, was infuriated by a visit to Ukraine this week by Taiwanese Vice President Lien.</p>
