<headline>H&amp;R Block Q1 loss impacted by expenses.</headline>
<dateline>KANSAS CITY, Mo. 1996-08-21</dateline>
<text>
<p>H&amp;R Block Inc, which offers tax and financial services, said its loss for the fiscal first quarter was due to anticipated increases in expenses associated with compensation, rent and utilities.</p>
<p>Incremental operating costs and amortization of goodwill from tax businesses acquired in fiscal 1996 also increased expenses for the quarter.</p>
<p>H&amp;R Block reported a net loss from continuing operations of $0.27 a share. A year ago, it had a net loss from continuing operations of $0.20 a share, which included a one-time gain realized on the MECA Software Inc sale and the write-down of certain impaired assets.</p>
<p>H&amp;R Block said its tax services business typically reports losses in the first three quarters. &quot;While most of the revenues for the tax business are generated in the fourth quarter, certain expenses remain year round,&quot; Frank Salizzoni, interim president, said in a statement.</p>
<p>Revenues from H&amp;R Block Tax Services' U.S. operations rose nearly 22 percent to $9.6 million in the quarter. Revenues from international tax operations increased more than 29 percent to $2.7 million. Revenues for Block Financial Corp increased nearly 31 percent to $8.2 million.</p>
