<headline>China says Japan has no legal claim to islands.</headline>

<p>China on Wednesday accused Japan of trying to twist international law to gain ownership of a group of disputed islands in the East China Sea which Beijing claims has been part of its territory for centuries.</p>
<p>A row between China and Japan over the Diaoyu Islands, which the Japanese call the Senkakus, erupted last month when members of a Japanese right-wing group built a makeshift lighthouse on one of them.</p>
<p>The basis of Japanese claims to sovereignty over the islands &quot;has not been universally accepted in international law and cannot justify Japan's aggression of Chinese territory&quot;, the official China Daily said.</p>
<p>The newspaper said the islands appeared in Chinese records dating to the 16th century and that Japan gained control over the islands only after defeating China in a war that ended in 1895.</p>
<p>The Senkakus are small uninhabited islands about 300 km (190 miles) west of Okinawa and 200 km (125 miles) east of Taiwan. The islands are also claimed by Taiwan.</p>
<p>&quot;It is obvious that Japan is trying to use its long-term control of the Diaoyu Islands to finally acquire their ownership,&quot; the newspaper said.</p>
<p>The newspaper said the islands should have been returned to Chinese control after the end of World War Two in 1945 and that they were still part of China despite regular Japanese patrols in the area.</p>
