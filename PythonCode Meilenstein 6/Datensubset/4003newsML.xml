<p>U.S. shares trading in London were largely static on caution ahead of the FOMC meeting later today, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's very quiet,&quot; said one dealer, &quot;We're waiting for the Fed to meet today and not much else is happening.&quot;</p>
<p>The Dow closed up 9.9 points on Monday to 5,699.44 in one of the slowest trading days of the year.</p>
<p>&quot;The market on the futures is very quiet today, and bonds are looking unchanged so the (Wall) Street will probably continue to be lethargic and quiet,&quot; one trader said.  </p>
<p>The September T-bond future was trading at 110-29/32, unchanged from the Chicago settlement.</p>
<p>The September S&amp;P index future was up 0.8 points at 669.0.</p>
<p>Among individual U.S. share movers in London traders said demand for Philip Morris was continuing after recent weakness in tobacco shares.</p>
<p>The shares were up $3/8 at $90-1/4 after gaining $1-1/4 to $89-7/8 in New York on Monday.</p>
<p>Shares in Chrysler Corp came off on news of South American joint venture plans with Detroit Diesel Corp.  </p>
<p>The shares were down $1/8 at $28-1/2 ahead of an announcement about the joint venture expected at 1100 EDT today.</p>
<p>General Motors was down $1/8 at $51-1/4 in sympathy.</p>
<p>News that AT&amp;T Corp's president, Alex Mandl, had resigned to head a new start-up company weighed on the shares. AT&amp;T was down $1/8 at $54 in London trade.</p>
