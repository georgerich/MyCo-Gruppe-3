<p>Trading in both wheat futures and options drifted on Thursday as potential players continued to hold their cards close to the chest.</p>
<p>One trader who did not wish to be named said many potential traders were holding bids and offers out of the market as a result of excessive caution.</p>
<p>&quot;They're worried if someone sees their bid ... people should just put their bids and offers into the market and that's how it starts trading,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Eleven futures trades took place on Thursday, all in the January contract which fell by A$2.50 to A$190.00 on the sale.  </p>
<p>Five call options traded, all also in January 1997, one in the A$200 contract at a A$7.50 premium, the others in the A$205 contract at a premium of A$6.00.</p>
<p>Ben Suttie of C A &amp; L Bell Commodities Corp Pty Ltd said he had more sellers than buyers and viewed the Australian market as &quot;a bit overdone and likely to come off further&quot;.</p>
<p>Chicago looked bearish short-term but bullish longer-term with US$5.00 a bushel expected by the end of the crop season, he said.</p>
<p>Suttie said he was recommending that producers sell into the cash market in Australia and buy call options in Chicago.  </p>
