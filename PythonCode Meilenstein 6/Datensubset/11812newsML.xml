<title>USA: Snoozing Vietnamese man takes slow train to Alaska.</title>
<headline>Snoozing Vietnamese man takes slow train to Alaska.</headline>
<dateline>ANCHORAGE, Alaska 1996-08-22</dateline>

<p>A Vietnamese man who tried to take a snooze in a railway boxcar in Canada found himself locked in and bound for Alaska with no food or water.</p>
<p>Officials in the port of Whittier said on Thursday that they found Tuan Quac Phan, 29, dehydrated, famished and terrified after sailing to Alaska from Canada in the boxcar loaded on a barge, a trip that takes about five days.</p>
<p>Sgt. Dan Jewell of the Whittier, Alaska police department described Phan as &quot;extremely cooperative&quot;. &quot;Seeing me in my uniform, he kept saying, Jail better. Jail better.'&quot;</p>
<p>Phan's accidental journey started last week in Prince Rupert, British Columbia, where he was searching for a fishing job, Jewell said.</p>
<p>&quot;He had climbed up in this boxcar to get out of the weather and to get some sleep,&quot; Jewell said. &quot;The next thing you know, the boxcar is coupled up and loaded up to a barge and headed north.&quot;</p>
<p>Police found Phan late on Monday when the boxcar, which was transporting lumber, was opened at Whittier, a port in western Prince William Sound. Officials fed Phan some soup, gave him medical care, kept him overnight and then fed him a large breakfast.</p>
