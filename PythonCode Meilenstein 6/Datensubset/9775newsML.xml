<p>The United Nations refugee agency said on Thursday it was sending a chartered cargo plane from Belgium at midnight with emergency relief supplies for Chechen civilians fleeing Grozny.</p>
<p>In a statement, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees also said that more than 23,000 Chechens had flooded into neighbouring Ingushetia and Dagestan in the last two weeks.</p>
<p>The Geneva-based agency said that as the crisis deepened in Chechnya, it had boosted its staff to 37 in the two Russian republics.</p>
<p>The total number of displaced Chechens in Dagestan and Ingushetia since Russian President Boris Yeltsin sent his forces to crush an independence drive in December 1994 stands at more than 100,000.</p>
<p>&quot;The supplies are for at least 23,000 Chechen civilians in Daghestan and Ingushetia. It is quite clear that more are on the road,&quot; UNHCR spokeswoman Ruth Marshall told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;More than 5,000 have arrived in the past 24 hours.&quot;</p>
<p>UNHCR said it was also distributing food parcels donated by the government of Saudi Arabia, sufficient to cover the needs of at least 20,000 people for one month.</p>
<p>In addition, two trucks left Amsterdam on Thursday to replenish UNHCR stocks in the northern Caucasus and a third was leaving on Friday. Travel time is estimated at 10 days.</p>
<p>The chartered plane, which will leave Ostend airport in Belgium, is scheduled to arrive at Vladikavkaz airport early on Friday morning (0500GMT), according to the UNHCR. The airport, in north Ossetia, is the biggest in the region.</p>
<p>The airlifted supplies will include blankets, plastic sheeting for shelter, jerry cans as well as basic cooking sets.</p>
