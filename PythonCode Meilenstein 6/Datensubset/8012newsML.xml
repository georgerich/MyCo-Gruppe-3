<p>Any Bundesbank decision not to cut its repo rate today will pile pressure on a French franc whose longer-term prospects are already bleak, analysts said.</p>
<p>With the market now deeply dubious over whether the German central bank will trim the repo, players know that Bundesbank inaction will buoy the mark and effectively strip the Bank of France of scope for making its own badly-needed easing.</p>
<p>&quot;If we don't see a Bundesbank cut today I expect the franc to come under pressure,&quot; said Thomas Rayner, international economist at Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull in London.</p>
<p>Widespread anticipation of a Bundesbank rate cut was stoked by subdued money supply growth this week, but a robust business climate survey from Germany's influential Ifo institute cast those expectations into question.</p>
<p>Steady German monetary policy today could get the market wondering whether the easing cycle is over, said Rayner. &quot;That will make it very hard for France to cut rates to get the economy going without the franc coming under pressure,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The one thing France desperately needs right now is lower interest rates to spur economic growth and enable it to meet the criteria for European monetary union, analysts said.</p>
<p>Such considerations are, however, seen cutting little ice with the powerful Bundesbank. Analysts say Germany will not wish to be seen setting policy simply to help out France.</p>
<p>Even if Germany trims a modest five or 10 basis points off its 3.30 percent repo rate, the franc will not be out of danger, said Tim Fox, treasury economist at Standard Chartered here.</p>
<p>A repo shave in light of the July Ifo reading -- which rose to 94.1 from 90.4 in June -- is likely to weaken the mark more than it might have done before the index appeared, but even then the French unit may not benefit for long, Fox said.</p>
<p>&quot;After the Ifo a lot more people are going for no cut so a small cut today may temper immediate deutschemark gains,&quot; he said. &quot;But beyond that it's expecting a lot to feel it's going to turn around the trend in the mark.&quot;</p>
<p>Some market watchers feel the franc may not suffer unduly even if the Bundesbank holds rates steady today. They point to the selling of francs for marks which greeted the Ifo survey, and say much of the move is now over.</p>
<p>&quot;There might be a bit of tension but I don't think people are going to rush out and buy more marks,&quot; said Andrew Chaveriat, technical analyst at Banque Paribas here.</p>
<p>But longer term the picture is not rosy for the franc.</p>
<p>With the French 1997 budget looming -- the government announces its national budget bill on September 17 -- market minds are fretting over the fiscal and structural problems of France's economy.</p>
<p>&quot;For the revenues they really have to rely on some kind of cuts and that's going to be very difficult, and they certainly can't raise taxes again because that would sink the consumer sector,&quot; said Chaveriat.</p>
<p>&quot;The problem is the focus on the budget and how they're going to get down to the theoretical three percent (government deficit to GDP) target for 1997,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Paribas expects the franc to remain fairly stable near its current level of around 3.42 per mark in the very short term, but sees it weakening by year-end to 3.45.</p>
