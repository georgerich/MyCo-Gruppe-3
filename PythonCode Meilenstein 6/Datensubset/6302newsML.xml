<p>An Iraqi Kurdish rebel group on Wednesday accused Iran of killing or wounding around 100 people in daily artillery attacks this week on its positions in a northern Iraqi enclave protected by Western allies.</p>
<p>&quot;They have been shelling the border area,&quot; Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) Ankara representative Safeen Dizayee said. &quot;It started on about (August) 18th,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>The KDP said in a statement that a four-hour Iranian bombardment of the Iraqi Kurdish village of Qasrey on Tuesday caused around 100 casualties.</p>
<p>&quot;The Iranian Islamic regime has entered the war on behalf of its (Patriotic Union of Kurdistan) PUK quisling,&quot; the KDP of veteran warlord Massoud Barzani said in a statement.</p>
<p>The PUK was not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>Barzani's group said Iranian forces had been firing heavy artillery shells and Katyusha rockets into northern Iraq from inside Iran every day since last weekend.</p>
<p>Fighting between the two Kurdish groups broke out at the weekend, shattering a ceasefire brokered by the United States early last year.</p>
<p>The KDP called on the Western allies to halt the shelling.</p>
<p>&quot;We appeal to member governments of Operation Provide Comfort protecting the Kurds to deter Iranian intervention in the Kurdish enclave of northern Iraq,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>A U.S., British and French air force, known as Provide Comfort, has been patrolling the skies of northern Iraq to prevent any attack from Baghdad since shortly after the end of the 1991 Gulf War.</p>
<p>&quot;This Iranian aggression has caused the death and injury of nearly 100 people and the displacement of tens of families,&quot; the group said.</p>
<p>A small number of Iranian troops briefly entered northern Iraq last month and killed around 20 members of an Iranian Kurdish group based there.</p>
<p>The mountainous region has been split into rival Iraqi Kurdish zones since fighting broke out between the two groups in 1994. Around 3,000 people died until the ceasefire last March.</p>
<p>The KDP, which controls the northern sector of the Kurdish-held territory in Iraq, said 25 of its fighters died and nearly 75 guerrillas and civilians were injured in Tuesday's bombardment at Qasrey.</p>
<p>The group abandoned its positions there to fighters from Jalal Talabani's PUK, the statement said.</p>
