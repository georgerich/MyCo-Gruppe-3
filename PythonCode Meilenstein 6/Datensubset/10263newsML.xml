<p>Household products and pharmaceutical group Reckitt &amp; Coleman Plc should report a near 13 percent rise in first half profits on Wednesday but its unlikely to help lift the share price, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect the results to be reasonably good but expectations post-results are for them to turn back a bit,&quot; a Kleinwort Benson analyst said. Kleinwort, which has moved the stock from a long-term &quot;buy&quot; to a &quot;hold&quot;, is looking for first-half pre-tax profit of 170.7 million stg with a dividend of 7.9 pence per share, in-line with the market consensus.  </p>
<p>But worries about competition affecting its future sales growth is likely to hold the share price down, said analysts.</p>
<p>&quot;Reckitt has said it hopes to improve earnings by adding value to its goods - in other words increase prices on its niche brands if the market will allow,&quot; one analyst who wished to remain anonymous said. &quot;The trouble is consumers are proving to be price resistant,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>He noted that the company was also facing competition in Britain from larger retail chains selling cheaper own-brand products even though the acquisition of L&amp;F means the majority of R&amp;C'S sales were outside the UK.  </p>
<p>&quot;The company may make some encouraging noises about Asia and Latin America but I expect the U.S. market (sales) is still going to be modest,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Reckitt has targeted South America and Asia where the company believes consumers are more influenced by brand names. Last year sales in eastern Asia rose by 25 percent while in Brazil turnover jumped by a fifth.</p>
<p>The Reckitt &amp; Coleman name used to be synonymous with Britain's favourite mustard but the company sold off most of its foods business last year, replacing it with U.S. group L&amp;F Household, which it bought for one billion stg.  </p>
<p>R&amp;C's stated aim is to become the world leader in household products and to dominate over-the-counter pharmaceuticals.</p>
