<p>Eisuke Sakakibara, a senior official at the Japanese Finance Ministry, was on Tuesday quoted as saying that even if the dollar rises above 110 yen, there is only a small chance of such a rise having an adverse effect on the Japanese economy.</p>
<p>If the dollar/yen exchange rate is to settle at around 110 yen, it would not be strange to see the yen weaken a bit more temporarily, Sakakibara, director-general of the Japanese Finance Ministry's International Finance Bureau, said in an interview with the Nikkei Financial Daily. The dollar was standing at around 108 yen in Tuesday's early Tokyo trade.  </p>
<p>Sakakibara was quoted as saying currency intervention takes full effect if it is in line with economic fundamentals, such as when the yen's sharp rise was reversed last summer.</p>
<p>The knack of intervention is to conduct it aggressively when the market is losing direction, and intervention on a large scale can create a flow for the market if it is conducted at turning points, he said.</p>
<p>To make intervention succeed, Sakakibara said, it is also necessary for the Ministry of Finance to get influential market operators on its side. He said he keeps in touch with hedge funds for this purpose.  </p>
<p>Sakakibara has been dubbed &quot;Mr Yen&quot; by the currency market because he is seen as the key person behind driving the dollar back up above 100 yen last year from its record low of 79.75 yen in April 1995.</p>
<p>In February this year, the central banks of Hong Kong and Singapore reached an agreement with Japan to carry out currency intervention on Tokyo's behalf.</p>
<p>In April, Japan agreed with the monetary authorities of several Asian nations to establish bilateral repurchase pacts using dollar assets to provide liquidity in times of financial crisis.</p>
<p>Sakakibara said he was thinking about a way of using yen-denominated assets to stabilise the currency market.</p>
<p>For this, he said, it was necessary to eliminate obstacles to foreign operators' investment in yen-denominated assets. He said that the monetary authorities of other Asian nations want well-established systems for Japanese bond settlements and short-term money markets.</p>
