<p>Russian flight controllers and ground workers plan to strike over a pay dispute from August 27, an air traffic controllers' union official said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Gennady Borisov, aide to the president of the Federation of Air Traffic Controller Unions, said regional unions and some Moscow controllers were ready to strike.</p>
<p>Aviation unions called two strikes this year, but regional leaders declined to join, and the strikes were cancelled. Officials from state-owned Aeroflot and private airlines Transaero and Orient-Avia said their workers would not strike.</p>
<p>Borisov said air traffic controllers at Moscow's Domodedovo, Vnukovo and Bykovo airports were ready to strike this time, but those at Sheremetyevo international airport had not decided.</p>
<p>The workers want pay rises to take account of inflation, guarantees of job security and special payments for working in &quot;dangerous conditions&quot;. Existing contracts expired on January 1 and negotiations broke down on July 31.</p>
<p>Federal Aviation Service head Gennady Zaitsev said last week that the unions' demands were &quot;unrealistic&quot;, since federal civial aviation services had no cash to spare.</p>
<p>Interfax news agency this month quoted chief government negotiator Robert Suleimanov as saying the strike would fail because aviation workers would refuse to back the unions.</p>
<p>Aeroflot deputy chief executive Valery Okulov said his airline's staff would not participate in the action.</p>
<p>&quot;All flights on August 27 and the following days will be made according to Aeroflot's schedule,&quot; Okulov said.</p>
