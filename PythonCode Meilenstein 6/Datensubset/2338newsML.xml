<p>The Australian dollar and bonds both went into quick retreat on Tuesday amid mild disappointment that the maiden budget by Australia's conservative government was not as tough as the markets had been led to believe.</p>
<p>Within an hour of the budget being announced on Tuesday night the dollar had sunk to US$0.7860/0.7865 from a pre-budget US$0.7883/88, while long dated bond yields rose some eight basis points taking the November 2006 bond back up to 8.0 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;It wasn't a complete disappointment, but this is the first of supposedly extremely tough budgets and it doesn't quite live up to expectations,&quot; said UBS chief economist Stephen Roberts.</p>
<p>The treasurer announced an underlying budget deficit of A$5.65 billion (US$4.46 billion) and a headline budget surplus of A$474 million for 1996/97 after savings of A$3.9 billion.</p>
<p>Median forecasts had centred on an underlying deficit of A$4.9 billion and a headline surplus of A$1.0 billion.</p>
<p>A total borrowing requirement of A$7.0 billion for 1996/97 was also larger than some analysts had expected.</p>
<p>The local bond market had rallied strongly in recent days in anticipation of a fiscal squeeze in the first conservative government budget in 14 years, but had been looking for cuts of over A$4.0 billion to maintain the momentum that had taken yields to their lowest level since March 1994.</p>
<p>The local dollar also lost its gloss after advancing to a three-week high of US$0.7933 at the start of the day amid repeated comments by the five-month-old government that the budget would pave the way for further cuts in interest rates.</p>
<p>&quot;If we can get our budget, intact, through the Senate, if we can get that low inflation locked in, then I think we can set up the chances for an easing in monetary policy,&quot; Costello said.</p>
<p>The dollar had slid to US$0.7700 after last month's surprise 50 basis points cut in official interest rates to 7.0 percent as it eroded the currency's yield advantage, and there are fears that a further reduction could see it fall to US$0.7600.</p>
<p>&quot;The next hurdle is going to be the passage of the budget through the Senate,&quot; said Bruce Freeland, chief economist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia. &quot;Difficulties in passing the budget have previously led to downward pressure on the Australian dollar and higher bond yields.&quot;</p>
<p>However, he added that recent statements by the minor parties in the Senate would seem to reduce the probability of the budget being blocked in the upper house.</p>
<p>The budget also painted a rosy outlook for the economy with growth forecast to average 3.5 percent over 1996/97 and underlying inflation at 2.75 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;It is probably mildly bearish for the markets because it was such a favourable economic outlook, rather than any failure on the fiscal tightening...,&quot; said Stephen Koukoulas, senior economist at Citibank Australia.</p>
<p>(A$1 = US$0.79)</p>
