<p>Britain's Securities and Futures Authority said on Wednesday it had fined New Japan Securities Europe 10,000 stg for a senior manager's misconduct.</p>
<p>The senior manager, Kikuo Watanabe, was expelled from the SFA's register of managers and from its register of representatives.  </p>
<p>The SFA said Watanabe, who had 15 years' experience in the New Japan group, had attempted to hide losses with deceitful accounting entries. It had instituted disciplinary proceedings against Watanabe and New Japan in June.</p>
<p>&quot;At the time of his misconduct he had both settlment and treasury functions. He was given authority to fund purchases of U.S. dollar denominated Euro commercial paper (ECP) by using foreign exchange contracts ass an alternative to borrowing U.S. dollars direct,&quot; the SFA said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;He then repaid the borrowings by converting the U.S. dollar received from maturing ECP into yen,&quot; it said.  </p>
<p>The SFA said authority to use foreign exchange was given on the strict understanding no open positions were to be taken.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite this clear instruction, Mr Watanabe entered into unmatched speculative foreign exchange trades which caused losses to NJSE (New Japan Securities Europe). He attempted to hide these losses by various deceiful accounting entries,&quot; it said in a statement.</p>
<p>The SFA said NJSE accepted it was in breach of its obligation to organise and control its internal affairs.</p>
<p>The firm also had asked its auditors to independently review its procedures and has implemented all recommendations made.  </p>
<p>The SFA said NJSE was required to pay costs of 4,700 stg and Watnabe was also required to pay costs of 3,100 stg.</p>
<p>The statement did not detail the size of the losses to NJSE or the amounts of money involved, but it said no client funds were put at risk from Watanabe's activity.</p>
