<headline>Russia's Lebed, Chechen rebel say agree ceasefire.</headline>

<p>Kremlin security chief Alexander Lebed and Chechen rebel chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov said they agreed a ceasefire on Wednesday night and Lebed said he would stop the Russian army from carrying out a threat to start bombing Grozny on Thursday morning.  </p>
<p>Lebed told reporters after meeting Maskhadov for over an hour near the village of Novye Atagi, south of the rebel-held Chechen capital, that the Russian army commander's ultimatum to bomb Grozny was &quot;a bad joke&quot; and said he had given an undertaking &quot;never again to give the Chechen side ultimatums&quot;.</p>
<p>Asked if he would prevent the generals' carrying out their threat, Lebed said: &quot;I am now going there (army headquarters near Grozny) to see to it that things will be quiet tomorrow.&quot;</p>
<p>He said he would meet the separatists in the same place at 10 a.m. (0600 GMT) on Thursday to continue the discussions he had had with Maskhadov on Wednesday on &quot;concrete decisions on a ceasefire and separating the warring sides&quot;.</p>
<p>Maskhadov said: &quot;We hope Lebed will be able to conquer those in Moscow who do not want to conclude the war...We hope that never again will it be like when we negotiated and then the next day federal forces began to bomb our villages.&quot;</p>
