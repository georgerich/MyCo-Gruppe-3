<p>Sri Lanka stocks closed range-bound on Thursday as sellers remained firmly on the sidelines, brokers said.</p>
<p>The Colombo Stock Exchange all share index closed 0.10 points higher at 556.60. Price declines outnumbered gains by 18 to 15.</p>
<p>The main gains of the day were tea firm John Keells Limited which rose 2.25 rupees to 28.25, and Ceylon Tobacco one rupee to 26.</p>
<p>Turnover was 6.99 million rupees on 292,732 shares. Foreign purchases were 2.39 million rupees, and sales were 1.86 million.</p>
<p>&quot;Though sluggish, there is buying interest in stock with value,&quot; said Dimantha Kohombawickramage of NDBS Stock Brokers.  </p>
<p>&quot;But the problem is to find shares,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Sellers have moved out since many have bought stocks when the index was at the 750 and 800-point levels, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;If you pay 10 to 15 percent premiums you can loosen sellers. But no buyer is interested in going that high,&quot; said one broker.</p>
<p>Richard Pieris &amp; Co, a manufacturing, trading and estate management firm, announced a first and final dividend of 20 percent, for the 1995/1996 financial year.</p>
