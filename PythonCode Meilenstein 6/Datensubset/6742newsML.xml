<p>European Union leaders charting the way forward for the bloc are in danger of agreeing a &quot;fudge&quot; by adopting the catch-all concept of &quot;flexibility&quot;, a leading British think-tank warned on Wednesday.</p>
<p>But the term means different things to the EU's political leaders, and cannot be used for long to cover up fundamental differences on the future for the 15-nation grouping, Frank Vibert, director of the European Policy Forum, said.</p>
<p>The EU has begun an Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) to review its institutions and pave the way for the admission of new members, including East European countries.</p>
<p>&quot;In the initial stages of the IGC, &quot;flexibility', often under the more positive sounding label of &quot;cooperation renforce' (reinforced cooperation) has appeared as the big idea in the discussions,&quot; Vibert wrote in a pamphlet.</p>
<p>But he said the terms masked a division between member states wanting a more decentralised Europe and those believing flexibility would enable an inner core of countries to pioneer new ways of extending the powers of community institutions.</p>
<p>&quot;(French) President (Jacques) Chirac, (German) Chancellor (Helmut) Kohl and (British) Prime Minister (John) Major each support &quot;flexibility'. Each means something different,&quot; he wrote.</p>
<p>Major has claimed credit in Britain for negotiating the country's right to opt out of two key EU policies -- the &quot;social chapter' which is designed to lay down basic employment rights, and the planned common EU currency.</p>
<p>France and Germany are members of the so-called Schengen group linking 10 of the EU's member states which is designed to promote freedom of movement by abolishing border controls.</p>
<p>However, said Vibert, the two countries disagree over control of the EU, with Germany seeing the bloc's executive Commission developing into a government of Europe but France wanting power to remain with meetings of member state ministers.</p>
<p>&quot;The limitation of concepts such as flexibility and cooperation renforce is that they may lead to agreements between governments which are simply viewed as fudge,&quot; Vibert said.</p>
<p>He said parliaments and public opinion might not accept political fudges on matters of great importance to them. &quot;It is an illusion to think that great differences about the shape of European political union can be contained for much longer.&quot;</p>
<p>Vibert said flexibility might be used to allow certain member states to cooperate in new areas, for instance the tackling of crime.</p>
<p>But in each instance, hard questions must be faced about about whether EU finance should be committed and whether the bloc's institutions should become involved.</p>
