<p>The price of the benchmark U.S. Treasury bond completed a full-point decline -- its yield reaching a three-week high -- in early afternoon trade.</p>
<p>U.S. Treasury prices had been under pressure ever since the government reported stronger-than-expected orders for durable goods in July.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a thin environment,&quot; explained Kevin Flanagan, first vice president and money market economist at Dean Witter Reynolds.  </p>
<p>&quot;The durable goods report was another shot across the bow that perhaps not all the economic numbers we get will be favorable for the market,&quot; Reynolds said. &quot;They might make it appear that the degree of deceleration in the economy might be less than what the market was counting on.&quot;</p>
<p>The 6-3/4 percent 30-year bond was down a point to 97-27/32 around 1220 EDT/1620 GMT, its yield at 6.92 percent, a three-week high.</p>
<p>Durable goods orders rose 1.6 pct in July, the government reported early in the trading session.</p>
<p>Without defense-related orders, the number was up 3.5 percent in July after falling 1.2 percent in June.</p>
