<p>Britain's sickly manufacturing sector showed a slight sign of recovery in August with firms reporting a modest rise in overall demand, the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said on Friday.</p>
<p>But its August Industrial Trends survey found orders are still well below normal levels for the time of year, hit in particular by sluggish demand for British goods abroad.</p>
<p>Only 19 percent of firms saw orders rise compared with 29 percent who saw them fall.</p>
<p>Firms have regarded orders as below normal for the time of year for 12 months in a row.  </p>
<p>&quot;Although manufacturing demand has improved to its best level so far this year, companies will find it difficult to raise more than one cheer,&quot; said Sudhir Junankar, associate director of economic analysis at the CBI.</p>
<p>He said total order books remain significantly below normal despite some improvement in home demand.</p>
<p>The survey showed demand from overseas has weakened further leaving export order books in their worst state since February 1994. Junankar said the European market in particular showed little sign of improvement with France and Germany very weak.  </p>
<p>Excessive levels of stocks continued to dog the industry, but fewer firms than last month reported stocks of finished goods are more than adequate to meet expected demand.</p>
<p>Given the persistently low level of demand, firms said they did not expect to raise their prices over the next four months.</p>
