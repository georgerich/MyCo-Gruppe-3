<p>Shares of Atmel Corp rebounded on Friday in heavy trading as investors scurried to cover short positions, Chief Financial Officer Kris Chellam told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;People put out negative information yesterday that I was going to downgrade (my earnings estimates for) the next two quarters and as the facts got out and people really understood what I said we got some buyers coming in,&quot; Chellam said.</p>
<p>He said the stock fell 2 to 24-7/8 Thursday as Wall Street short players misinterpreted comments he made at a luncheon.  </p>
<p>On Friday, Amtel topped the most active list on Nasdaq with shares climbing 1-3/4 to 26-5/8 on volume of over seven million shares as it became clear Chellam's remarks were not as negative as some initially thought.</p>
<p>&quot;At the luncheon, unfortunately, there was some short interest players in the room and they took some of the comments I made and turned it into negative. It was a misunderstanding of what I said,&quot; Chellam said.</p>
<p>&quot;The only comment I made is that the visibility in the industry has changed, it's no different for us,&quot; he added.  </p>
<p>Chellam told analysts visibility, meaning how far in advance Atmel customers book orders, had dropped dramatically from the traditional three to six month period.</p>
<p>&quot;Some people asked some hypothetical questions and I gave some hypothetical answers and some of them turned that around and implied that I said the company's gross margins were about to go down in Q4. I never actually said that,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Chellam declined to comment on whether he is comfortable with analysts' earnings estimates but said Friday he did not feel the need to give analysts any &quot;guidance&quot; at this time.  </p>
<p>&quot;If we felt for any reason that we had concerns with meeting numbers we would make a press release,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Chellam did say that orders in the third quarter were slow and that in a reduced visbility market it was hard to predict how the company would fare in the fourth quarter which is when Atmel does 80 percent of its business.</p>
<p>&quot;Third quarter business is proceeding pretty fairly. Eighty percent of my end market is seasonally in the December quarter because of Christmas,&quot; he said. &quot;There's no reason to believe that even though bookings may be seasonally slow there won't be an upturn in business in Q4 to grow the numbers.&quot;  </p>
<p>That lower visibility caused Needham &amp; Co on Friday to cut its recommendation on the stock to buy from strong buy.</p>
<p>&quot;Needham basically downgraded the stock only because they felt that with limited visibility Atmel could not consistently beat estimates going forward,&quot; Chellam said. &quot;I didn't say for a fact that we could or could not exceed estimates, it was just an estimate that they made based on reduced visibility.&quot;</p>
<p>Chellam said he did see signs of hope for the fourth quarter with a pick-up of activity particularly in the consumer market and the telecom sector.  </p>
<p>&quot;We've seen some signs of pickup in the U.S marketplace,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Analysts agreed with Chellam's prognosis, noting that Atmel has a heavy short position</p>
<p>&quot;Some of the things he said were taken in the wrong context,&quot; said Justin Burgin, analyst at Olde Discount Corp.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a lot of shares short, close to 10 million shares short, and there's only 100 million shares outstanding, so that's a pretty good chunk and you may be getting a short squeeze,&quot; Burgin said. &quot;Atmel has yet to disappoint in this entire chip downturn.&quot;</p>
<p>San Jose-based Atmel makes a broad range of integrated circuits.</p>
