<p>Pakistani authorities called out troops and declared a state of emergency in the city of Lahore on Friday after torrential rain caused floods and at least seven deaths and six injuries, state television reported.</p>
<p>Police said a woman and her two children were killed when their house collapsed after heavy rains in Shahadra, a suburb of Lahore, capital of the populous province of Punjab. It was not immediately clear how the other casualties had occurred.</p>
<p>The floods knocked out power and water supplies in many parts of the city, put 15,000 telephone lines out of action, caused houses to collapse, choked drainage systems and brought transport to a standstill, the official APP news agency said.</p>
<p>&quot;Due to continuous rain, an emergency has been declared and the army has been called in for help,&quot; a statement by the district magistrate's office said.</p>
<p>&quot;Police and civil defence forces have been mobilised to rescue people and an emergency cell has been set up at the deputy commissioner's office,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Witnesses said many houses had crumbled and army troops were helping to evacuate residents from low-lying areas. Evacuees were given temporary accommodation in school buildings.</p>
<p>Mosque loudspeakers broadcast prayers for the rain to stop, but few people turned up for Friday worship.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Flood Forecasting Bureau in Lahore said the Ravi and Chenab rivers were in exceptionally high flood at several points after heavy rain in catchment areas.</p>
<p>&quot;The rains in the upper and lower catchment area have not stopped for the last 36 hours,&quot; the spokesman said, adding that the department had warned all concerned government agencies.</p>
<p>He said the Ravi, which runs past Lahore, would be in medium to high flood during the night, but was unlikely to break its banks.</p>
<p>Life came to a near-standstill as streets turned into canals with water up to two metres (six feet) deep. Motor vehicles could not be used and only boats, horse-drawn carriages and wagons were on the streets.</p>
<p>The Meteorological Department said 373 mm (more than 14-1/2 inches) of rain had fallen in Lahore in the past 36 hours.</p>
<p>Pakistan receives an average of 140 mm (5-1/2 inches) during the whole of the three-month monsoon season. Officials said they could not say whether the Lahore downpour had broken records.</p>
<p>&quot;We are too busy to check right now, but it is certainly extraordinarily high,&quot; said one official at the department.</p>
<p>&quot;I've never seen anything like it in 50 years,&quot; said Tahir Mashadi, 70, stranded at home like most Lahore residents.</p>
