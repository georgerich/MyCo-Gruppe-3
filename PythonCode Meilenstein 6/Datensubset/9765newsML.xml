<p>A U.N. official on Thursday said he estimated technical arrangements to implement the Iraqi oil-for-food deal could be completed in 7-10 days.</p>
<p>But the official, Shaukat Fareed, a director in the U.N. Department of Humanitarian affairs, said this was an optimistic estimate.</p>
<p>&quot;A week to 10 days is our hope but it could very easily take longer,&quot; he told Reuters after briefing the Security Council on progress made in implementing the accord allowing Iraq to sell $2 billion worth of oil over six months in order to buy badly-needed food and medicine.  </p>
<p>Fareed said technical details remained but there were no political problems forseen and most of the monitors needed initially were lined up and on their way.</p>
<p>When arrangements are completed, Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali must report to the Security Council that the six-month clock can begin running. The council has to acknowledge it received the report but not vote on it.</p>
<p>More than 260 from U.N. agencies or hired by the United Nations will be involved in the process, 600 of them alone in the Kurdish North.  </p>
<p>Western diplomats on Wednesday told Reuters that the administrative arrangements necessary before first Iraqi oil can flow remained about two weeks away.</p>
<p>They said that four overseers, independent experts from the United States, France, Russia and Norway, who will approve oil sales contracts on a day-to-day basis are expected to be in place at the United Nations this week.</p>
<p>Once in place, Baghdad must submit its pricing mechanism, a step which is expected to take place next week. This will consist of a pricing formula to be used for term contract sales based on three regional benchmark crudes - North Sea Brent for Europe, West Texas Intermediate for the Americas and Dubai for the Middle and Far East.</p>
<p>Iraq will also be permitted to sell its oil on the spot market, subject to sanctions committee approval, at market prices rather than formula prices, diplomats said.</p>
<p>The United Nations named the four overseers on August 8, the date the Security Council's sanctions committee adopted procedures for how the oil would be sold and the food and other goods purchased..</p>
<p>Since procedures were adopted, U.N. officials have worked to finalize the last bits of the oil-for-food scheme, aimed at easing the impact of sanctions iposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait six years ago.</p>
