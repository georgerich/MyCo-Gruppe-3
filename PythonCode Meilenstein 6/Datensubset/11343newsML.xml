<p>The pilot of a Cuban plane hijacked to waters off Florida last week returned to his homeland on Friday, a day after the three men charged with the hijacking were indicted, U.S. officials said.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's office in Fort Myers, Florida, said the identity of the pilot was not being released, citing a policy of not identifying witnesses. But Cuban officials identified him as Adolfo Perez Pantoja, 47.</p>
<p>Cuban state media said Perez flew into Havana on Thursday on a flight from Miami.</p>
<p>On Thursday, a federal grand jury sitting in Fort Myers had released a one-count indictment against Adel Regalado Ulloa, 22, Leonardo Reyes Ramirez, 27, and Jose Roberto Bello Puente, 22, all of Havana, charging them with air piracy.</p>
<p>On Aug. 16, 1996, an aircraft operated by Cuban Aero Taxi Service of Havana crashed into the Gulf of Mexico off Florida's west coast. Its captain and three passengers were rescued by crew members from a nearby Russian freighter.</p>
<p>According to the indictment, the three alleged hijackers had forced the pilot after takeoff on a regularly scheduled domestic flight to steer the aircraft toward the United States by threatening him with force and violence, including assault with a deadly weapon.</p>
<p>The three alleged hijackers had asked for political asylum after being turned over to U.S. authorities, while the pilot asked to return home.</p>
<p>If convicted, the defendants face a mandatory minimum of 20 years imprisonment without the possibility of parole and as much as life imprisonment. They each also face a fine up to $250,000 and up to five years supervised release.</p>
<p>The Cuban government has asked the U.S. government to honour existing immigration accords and return the alleged hijackers to Cuba.</p>
