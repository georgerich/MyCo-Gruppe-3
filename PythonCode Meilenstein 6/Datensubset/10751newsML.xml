<headline>FOMC voted 11-1 for steady rates at July 2-3 meet.</headline>

<text>
<p>The Federal Open Market Committee voted 11 to one at its July 2-3 meeting to keep short-term U.S. interest rates steady with a bias toward tightening, according to minutes released on Friday.</p>
<p>Since the July meeting, the FOMC has again convened on August 20 and again elected to keep interest rates unchanged.</p>
<p>The minutes of that meeting will not be made public until after the next gathering scheduled for September 24.  </p>
<p>Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis Gary Stern dissented &quot;because he was was convinced that a modestly more restrictive policy was warranted,&quot; the minutes said.</p>
<p>Beside concern about the economy's momentum and strains on resources, Stern dissented for an immediate tightening because &quot;current circumstances were favorable for policy action to reduce inflation further.&quot;</p>
<p>Although the FOMC adopted an inter-meeting tightening bias, &quot;several members commented that an asymmetric directive did not imply a commitment to tighten policy monetary policy at some point,&quot; the m,inutes said.  </p>
<p>Some members cautioned a tightening bias may &quot;have a more pronounced effect than usual because it would indicate a shift in the direction of policy and might generate expectations of further tightening,&quot; the minutes also said.</p>
<p>The FOMC agreed the 5.25-percent federal funds rate would not be raised inter meetings without further consultation.</p>
<p>&quot;Under the circumstances, the Committee would consult in some way before any policy tightening was undertaken,&quot; the minutes also said.</p>
<p>Some members saw the risk that a delayed policy action may result in more aggressive tightening moves.  </p>
<p>The minutes showed a consensus at the FOMC in July that &quot;the current stance of monetary policy could not be described in this view as clearly accomodative.&quot;</p>
<p>Based on this assessment, the 11 members who voted to keep rates steady &quot;preferred or could accept an asymmetric directive that was biased toward restraint,&quot; the minutes said.</p>
<p>The minutes showed an FOMC consensus around the view &quot;the most likely outcome was a slowing of the expansion to a more sustainable pace and a continuation of subdued inflation.&quot;</p>
<p>Given the momentum in the econmy, the FOMC members reiterated the need for added vigilance.  </p>
<p>&quot;The members saw a substantial risk that if economic growth did not slow in line with their current foreceasts, the resulting added pressures on resources would at some point translate into higher price inflation,&quot; the minutes said.</p>
<p>&quot;The factors bearing on the outlook for resource use and inflation needed to be monitored with special care in this period,&quot; the minutes also said.</p>
<p>Still, the FOMC members saw &quot;the outlook for inflation as a source of substantial uncertainty&quot; and said it would depend on the performance of food and energy prices as well as on &quot;underlying cost pressures in the economy.&quot;  </p>
<p>Several FOMC members noted &quot;the levels of of utilization of capital and labor resources that had prevailed over the past couple of years would have been expected on the basis of past historical patterns, to foster rising cost pressures and greater inflation.&quot;</p>
<p>The minutes, however, noted that, despite a unemployment rate &quot;and widespread anecdotal reports of tight labor markets across the country, there were only limited indications in national data that wage inflation might be increasing.&quot;</p>
<p>Looking forward, the FOMC members expected housing to dampen the expansion due to higher mortgage rates.  </p>
<p>The FOMC members also expected consumer spending to moderate, reflecting &quot;the projected slowing in income growth,&quot; the impact of consumers' debt burden and the satisfaction of pent-up demand.</p>
<p>Business expenditures, overall, were expected to grow at a slower pace with &quot;spending for computer equipment ... thought likely to remain buoyant.&quot;</p>
<p>The FOMC viewed &quot;business inventory investment... as a key upside risk in the economic outlook for coming quarters.&quot; The minutes noted inventory investment has turned positive though &quot;current inventory-to-ratios appeared to be relatively lean.&quot;</p>
