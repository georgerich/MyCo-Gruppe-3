<title>UK: LME copper drifts lower with weaker spreads.</title>
<headline>LME copper drifts lower with weaker spreads.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-08-20</dateline>
<text>
<p>Copper prices drifted lower in routine trade on the London Metal Exchange (LME) on Tuesday, weighed down by light Far Eastern selling, a rise in stocks and weakening nearby spreads.</p>
<p>Other base metals were narrowly mixed at the end of another sluggish day.</p>
<p>Three month copper futures finished the afternoon kerb at $1,931 a tonne against Monday's afternoon close of $1,942.</p>
<p>Cash narrowed to a $40/45 premium over three month values from $57 on Monday. Analysts were not ruling out further losses in the short term as bearish sentiment prevailed.  </p>
<p>&quot;In the short term we could see a test of $1,900 support, and $1,880 would need to hold below that,&quot; said William Adams of Rudolf Wolff.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think the market is looking particularly strong at the moment,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Copper stocks rose 5,000 tonnes, which was in line with market expectations, but underlined the strong rising trend in inventory levels.</p>
<p>&quot;Stocks may well get up towards 300,000 tonnes total (from 266,000 on Tuesday) by the end of the slow summer period, and that could encourage good lending,&quot; a trader said.  </p>
<p>Aluminium finished marginally weaker at $1,489 from $1,490 having hit a low of $1,482. Stocks rose 2,900 tonnes.</p>
<p>Prices were trapped in a downward price channel and needed to break above $1,510 to escape to the upside.</p>
<p>Nickel prices finished on a strong note, gaining $65 to $7,185 despite dipping to $7,070 at one stage.</p>
<p>Routine buying emerged during the afternoon session after an increase in stocks of 114 tonnes pulled values back earlier on.</p>
<p>Traders said further deliveries into the LME could be expected over the next few weeks and months as off-warrant metal was put on warrant.  </p>
<p>Zinc failed to react to a sizeable stockdraw, with traders comfortable with overall inventories while demand was subdued.</p>
<p>Stocks fell 4,050 tonnes but prices edged back $2 to $1,031.</p>
<p>&quot;At 8.5 weeks' (consumption) the current stocks ratio is an improvement on the 9.4 weeks' ruling at the end of 1995 but has some way to go still before a sustained rise is reflected in prices,&quot; said brokers Brandeis in a report.</p>
<p>Lead gained $3 to $824 while stocks rose 1,075 tonnes.</p>
<p>Tin gained $10 to $6,160 after stocks rose 155 tonnes while alloy was last at $1,280/83 from $1,300. Stocks fell 200 tonnes. --Mike Collett-White, London Newsroom +44 171 542 8057</p>
