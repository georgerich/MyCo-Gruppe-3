<p>King Hussein invited members of the lower house of parliament to his palace on Thursday after Jordan's worst unrest in seven years following a doubling of bread prices.</p>
<p>The king antagonised many Jordanians on Saturday when he suspended the summer session of parliament, where a majority of deputies opposed the price rise, and vowed an &quot;iron fist&quot; against unrest.</p>
<p>The king's action had increased anger at Prime Minister Abdul-Karim al-Kabariti, who ignored parliament's views and pushed ahead with his bread decision last Tuesday.</p>
<p>Parliamentary officials said the full 80-seat lower house had been invited to the palace for lunch. Those attending included 23 opposition deputies who had threatened to boycott parliament until the government reversed the price rise.</p>
<p>Some from the riot-striken south had boycotted a meeting with Kabariti on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The king blamed Iraq for the trouble, while critics said unrest reflected economic hardship. But since containing the riots he has begun rebuilding his links with society and staging displays of unity.</p>
<p>He has held a series of meetings with popular representatives and dignitaries since Sunday.</p>
<p>&quot;The king is personally intervening to calm things down and put the pieces together by going down to the street and meeting as many popular representatives as possible,&quot; said a deputy who supported the government bread policy.</p>
<p>&quot;From a security point of view, unrest has been contained,&quot; he added. &quot;Now he has to work on economic measures to ease the burden on the people and reassure an agitated public that he is still committed to democracy, parliament and freedoms.&quot;</p>
<p>Bread is a staple for the poor majority of Jordan's 4.2 million population, facing falling standards of living, unemployment and still awaiting promised economic dividends from the controversial 1994 peace treaty with Israel.</p>
<p>Kabariti felt he had to raise bread prices to close a gaping budget deficit that threatened to undermine the next stage of an IMF economic reform plan and the vital loans it would bring.</p>
<p>In a show of support, the International Monetary Fund on Wednesday released $60 million for Jordan, the second tranche in a $295 million loan to help finance the plan.</p>
<p>At Thursday's lunch, the opposition group, led by the Islamic Action Front Party (IAF), planned to give the king a petition demanding the release of detainees, an end to the military presence in the southern city of Karak and a reversal of the bread hikes.</p>
<p>But they dropped demands for Kabariti to leave, saying it was futile while the king remained committed to him.</p>
<p>Riots began in Karak, quickly spread to nearby centres after noon Moslem prayers and by Saturday night there were clashes in Amman. The army has eased the curfew on Karak as normality returns, but over 200 political activists and suspects remain in detention, officials said.</p>
<p>Officials announced the delaying of the start of the academic year for thousands of children across the kingdom by a week because of the riots.</p>
<p>The official said the decision was to allow the ministry &quot;to undertake the necessary maintenance to repair the damage to school buildings in some areas&quot;. But other government officials said the move was a precaution to head off any trouble at schools. There are nearly 1.3 million students.</p>
