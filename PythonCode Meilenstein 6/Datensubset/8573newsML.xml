<title>AUSTRALIA: TENNIS-NEWCOMBE PONDERS HIS DAVIS CUP FUTURE.</title>

<p>Australian Davis Cup captain John Newcombe on Thursday signalled his possible resignation if his team loses an away tie against Croatia next month.</p>
<p>The former Wimbledon champion said the immediate future of Australia's Davis Cup coach Tony Roche could also be determined by events in Split.</p>
<p>&quot;If we lose this one, Tony and I will have to have a good look at giving someone else a go,&quot; Newcombe was quoted as saying in Sydney's Daily Telegraph newspaper.</p>
<p>Australia face Croatia in the world group qualifying tie on clay from September 20-22.</p>
<p>Under Newcombe's leadership, Australia were relegated from the elite world group last year, the first time the 26-time Davis Cup winners had slipped from the top rank.</p>
<p>Since taking over as captain from Neale Fraser in 1994, Newcombe's record in tandem with Roche, his former doubles partner, has been three wins and three losses.</p>
<p>Newcombe has selected Wimbledon semifinalist Jason Stoltenberg, Patrick Rafter, Mark Philippoussis, and Olympic doubles champions Todd Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde to face the Croatians.</p>
<p>The home side boasts world number six Goran Ivanisevic, and Newcombe conceded his players would be hard-pressed to beat the Croatian number one.</p>
<p>&quot;We are ready to fight to our last breath -- Australia must play at its absolute best to win,&quot; said Newcombe, who described the tie as the toughest he has faced as captain.</p>
<p>Australia last won the Davis Cup in 1986, but they were beaten finalists against Germany three years ago under Fraser's guidance.</p>
