<title>UK: HSBC sells Premium Credit to Vendcrown.</title>
<headline>HSBC sells Premium Credit to Vendcrown.</headline>

<p>London-based banking giant HSBC Holdings said on Friday its subsidiary HSBC Gibbs had completed the sale of Premium Credit Limited to Vendcrown in a leveraged buyout, financed by short-term debt provided by Electra Fleming.</p>
<p>HSBC Gibbs received 40.3 million stg in cash under the terms of the deal, and a 19.9 percent interest in the ordinary equity of Vendcrown as well as unsecured loan notes and redeemable cumulative preference shares, HSBC said in a statement.  </p>
<p>HSBC said in May it wanted to sell the unit -- which provides finance for the payment of corporate finance premiums and payment facilities for personal insurance, school fees and subscriptions -- because of a potential conflict of interest.</p>
<p>HSBC Gibbs Limited is a Lloyd's of London insurance broker and competes with some of Premium Credit's clients.</p>
<p>It has rejected suggestions that information may pass between the two, but noted that such concerns had grown as the two businesses expanded.</p>
<p>This, HSBC said, had led it to look for a substantial partner in Premium Credit.  </p>
<p>HSBC said Vendcrown was established by the management of Premium Credit.</p>
<p>Electra Fleming is 50 percent owned by Electra Investment Trust Plc and 50 percent by Robert Fleming Holdings Limited, HSBC said.</p>
