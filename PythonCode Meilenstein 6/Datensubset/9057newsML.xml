<p>Nigerian Major General Sam Victor Malu took over on Thursday as commander of the ECOMOG peacekeeping force in Liberia, two days after the start of the latest ceasefire in the six-year civil war.</p>
<p>Malu replaced another Nigerian major general, John Inienger, who told officers at the handover ceremony that peace was now at hand for Liberia after six years of fighting and more than a dozen failed accords.</p>
<p>&quot;The search for peace in Liberia has been difficult, challenging and sometimes painful. Peacekeepers were harassed, killed and taken hostage,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is difficult but I want to assure you that peace is in sight.&quot;</p>
<p>United Nations military observers travelling to the western town of Tubmanburg on Wednesday to monitor the ceasefire were delayed by shooting along the highway, U.N. special representative Anthony Nyakyi said. They finally went ahead with an escort from the ULIMO-J faction.</p>
<p>Faction leaders who agreed a new peace deal in the Nigerian capital Abuja on Saturday have accused each other of breaking the ceasefire.</p>
<p>The latest peace deal foresees the disarmament of an estimated 60,000 combatants and sets a target date of May 30 next year for elections.</p>
<p>The ECOMOG force, currently 10,000 strong, was sent to Liberia by the Economic Community of West African States in 1990 at the height of the fighting.</p>
