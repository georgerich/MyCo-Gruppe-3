<title>SYRIA: Jordan riots against peace with Israel - radicals.</title>

<p>Radical Palestinian groups said on Wednesday that riots in Jordan over higher bread prices were also against Jordan's peace deal with Israel.</p>
<p>The 10-member alliance, which opposes peace moves with Israel, in a statement also expressed support to Jordanians and urged the government to abandon the peace deal which it signed with Israel in 1994.</p>
<p>&quot;The slogans of this (Jordanian) uprising not only expressed the people's opposition to hiking prices of goods but also to all of the regime's policies...,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>&quot;The policies (are those) which were embodied in implementing the Araba (peace) deal and normalisation with the Zionist enemy.&quot;</p>
<p>Riots flared last week in the southern Jordanian town of Karak and spread to nearby towns after the Jordanian government increased bread prices under IMF-agreed economic reforms.</p>
<p>&quot;The Palestinian Alliance expresses solidarity and support with the Jordanians in their just struggle to cancel the government's measure of raising bread prices and other basic goods, and to wreck the Araba deal which failed to put an end to Jordan's economic crisis as the Jordanian regime promised since signing it,&quot; the alliance statement said.</p>
<p>&quot;The only way for Jordan to get out of its economic crisis is to abandon its loyality to the Zionist alliance and return to the Arab solidarity,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>The Palestinian Alliance, which vows to wreck the PLO-Israeli peace deal, includes the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP), and the Islamic movements Hamas and Jihad which claimed several suicide attacks in Israel.</p>
