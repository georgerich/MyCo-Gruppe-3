<p>Russia's top military commander in Chechnya, Lieutenant-General Vyacheslav Tikhomirov, said on Wednesday he favoured &quot;most decisive measures&quot; to drive rebels from the regional capital Grozny, Interfax news agency said.</p>
<p>Interfax quoted Tikhomirov as saying the separatist fighters should not expect further warnings. Tikhimirov, whose acting commander threatened to bomb Grozny if rebels do not withdraw in 48 hours, has just returned from vacation.</p>
<p>Acting commander Konstantin Pulikovsky never specified exactly when his ultimatum started, but the Russian media appear to asume that it runs out at midnight (2000 GMT on Wednesday).</p>
<p>&quot;They (the rebels) will not live to see further loose warnings from me,&quot; Tikhomirov said.</p>
<p>Separatist fighters seized much of Grozny on August 6 and have so far resisted Russian attempts to win the city back.</p>
<p>President Boris Yeltsin, who has not been seen in public since his inauguration for a second term on August 9, has ordered his national security supremo Alexander Lebed to restore Russian control over Grozny before the end of the month.</p>
<p>But the policy-making Security Council, where Lebed is the secretary, said in a statement on Wednesday that this order could lead to fresh bloodshed in Chechnya.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands people have died in Chechnya since Yeltsin sent troops there in December 1994 to crush the region's independence drive.</p>
