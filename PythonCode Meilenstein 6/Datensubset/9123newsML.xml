<title>RUSSIA: Yeltsin meets candidates for new ministerial jobs.</title>
<headline>Yeltsin meets candidates for new ministerial jobs.</headline>
<dateline>MOSCOW 1996-08-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>President Boris Yeltsin, back in the Kremlin after a two-day holiday, moved to complete his government team on Thursday and met several candidates for top ministerial jobs.</p>
<p>Russian news agencies said decrees naming the new ministers would be signed in the near future.</p>
<p>Itar-Tass news agency said Pyotr Rodionov -- not to be confused with defence minister Igor Rodionov -- was named fuel and energy minister, Yuri Bespalov is the new industry minister, Anatoly Zaitsev is minister for railway communications and Viktor Orlov is minister for natural resources.</p>
<p>Tatyana Dmitrieva, the new health minister, is the only woman so far in the new cabinet of Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.</p>
<p>Most ministers were appointed earlier this month after Yeltsin was inaugurated for a second term as Russian president.</p>
<p>But a list of ministers left some posts vacant. Yeltsin has still not named a minister for culture or one responsible for relations with other former Soviet states.</p>
<p>The agencies gave no details of what was discussed at the meetings between Yeltsin and the candidates.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, 65, has not been seen in public since he was inaugurated for a second term on August 9.</p>
<p>His absence prompted speculation that he was ill but aides insisted he was just resting after a gruelling reelection campaign.</p>
