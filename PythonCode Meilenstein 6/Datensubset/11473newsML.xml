<p>The 12-year-old daughter of Republican Gov. William Weld is working to stop his bid to win a U.S. Senate seat because she doesn't want to leave Massachusetts.</p>
<p>Weld conceded his 12-year-old daughter, Franny, is &quot;a foot soldier&quot; for Democratic incumbent Sen. John Kerry, even though she isn't old enough to vote.</p>
<p>Weld, speaking on WBUR-FM radio on Thursday, said he was facing a revolt from his daughter in part because she does not want to leave Cambridge, Massachusetts, and move to Washington.</p>
<p>He also said Franny Weld's best friend, Tracy Roosevelt, might have something to do with her politics. Tracy is the great-granddaughter of Democratic former President Franklin Roosevelt, and support for Democrats runs in the family.</p>
<p>The Roosevelts are good friends of Weld and his wife, Susan Roosevelt Weld, a descendant of former President Theodore Roosevelt, who won the presidency as a Republican.</p>
