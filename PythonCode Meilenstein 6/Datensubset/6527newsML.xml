<p>ARA fuel oil bunker prices firmed on Wednesday as barges strengthened again and sellers had to settle for a small enquiries and fixtures.</p>
<p>Rotterdam 380 CST fuel oil was up another $1 to $100/$102 fob. Fuel oil barges hit a high of $100 in early trading. Dealers said there were a number of bunker enquiries, but the volume of each was small. Large buyers were discouraged by prevailing high prices, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;The enquiries are of insubstantial volumes. I think the biggies are postponing their purchases for as long as possible,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>Hamburg bunkers were steady and the market suffered from the same thinness of activity as Rotterdam.</p>
<p>In the Mediterranean, bunker prices were up on average $2 a tonne. As in the north, enquiries were numerous, but did not lead to substantial business. Dealers said gas oil and diesel buyers expected price falls on Thursday after futures losses.</p>
<p>Durban prices remained firm with slight talk of prompt shortages. Dealers said supply should increase by late August.</p>
