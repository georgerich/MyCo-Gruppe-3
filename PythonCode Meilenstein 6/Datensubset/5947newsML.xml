<title>RUSSIA: Lebed, rebel Chechen commander begin talks.</title>
<headline>Lebed, rebel Chechen commander begin talks.</headline>
<dateline>NOVYE ATAGI, Russia 1996-08-21</dateline>
<text>
<p>Alexander Lebed, President Boris Yeltsin's envoy to Chechnya, began a meeting in the region on Wednesday with Aslan Maskhadov, chief-of-staff of separatist forces who seized the capital Grozny two weeks ago.</p>
<p>Lebed was earlier quoted as saying he would peacefully resolve the issue of a Russian army ultimatum to bomb the city from Thursday morning. He declined to speak to reporters when he arrived for the talks at the village of Novye Atagi, 20 km (12 miles) south of Grozny.  </p>
<p>General Konstantin Pulikovsky, the acting Russian commander in Chechnya, gave the people of Grozny 48 hours from Tuesday morning to clear the city before he launched an all-out bombardment. On his return from holiday, his superior, General Vyacheslav Tikhomirov, said on Wednesday he too favoured &quot;the most decisive measures&quot; to dislodge the rebels.</p>
<p>But Lebed, given sweeping powers by Yeltsin last week to settle the 20-month Chechen conflict, has made clear he wants a peaceful solution and disapproves of bombing. Russian warplanes and artillery bombarded the city for several hours on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Lebed was quoted by Interfax news agency after meeting Tikhomirov earlier on Wednesday evening as saying Pulikovsky's ultimatum had not been approved by Russia's leadership.</p>
<p>&quot;Nobody agreed it with anyone. Everything is as it was, no one has given anyone any powers. You simply have to take it, as I am quietly doing,&quot; Lebed said. &quot;Here we have to restore a single command structure. There will be no more ultimatums.&quot;</p>
