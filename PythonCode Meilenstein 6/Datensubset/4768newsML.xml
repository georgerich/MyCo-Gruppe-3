<title>MALAYSIA: KL short-term rates up on Bank Negara intervention.</title>
<headline>KL short-term rates up on Bank Negara intervention.</headline>
<dateline>KUALA LUMPUR 1996-08-20</dateline>
<text>
<p>Short-term interbank rates in Kuala Lumpur rose by 10-20 basis points after Bank Negara intervened in the market to borrow for a one-month deposit, dealers said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>They said one-month interbank rose to 7.10/15 percent against 7.00/05 before the intervention.</p>
<p>One-week money was at 6.80/00 percent against 6.50/60 and two-week at 6.90/00 against 6.60/70.  </p>
<p>There were gains in longer-term rates too. Three-month interbank rate was up at 7.20/25 against 7.15/18 in early trading and six-month money rose to 7.25/30 against 7.23/25.</p>
<p>Earlier, Bank Negara Malaysia returned to the market after nearly three months to borrow for a one-month deposit at 6.95 to 7.05 percent against 6.95 previously.</p>
<p>The borrowing was part of the central bank's open market operations. Bank Negara regularly intervenes in the local interbank market to keep a check on liquidity or set interest rates as part of its efforts to fight inflation.  </p>
<p>But, it has not been in the market since May 24 despite rising liquidity that has pressured rates downward, threatening to thwart the Bank's tight monetary policy.</p>
<p>Money market dealers said the intervention indicated that Bank Negara has not eased its tight monetary policy.</p>
<p>While the volume that Bank Negara took was not known, it was expected to give a psychological boost to interest rates, particularly for short-term rates, dealers said.</p>
