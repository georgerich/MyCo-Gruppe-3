<p>Japanese oil firms will step up kerosene imports for the winter, but by how much will likely be dictated by the amount processed at home as refiners make plans with an eye on availability from Singapore, a key supplier.</p>
<p>Domestic stocks of kerosene are now at low levels and will need to be replenished for winter requirements, and at least part of this will be covered by imports, traders say.</p>
<p>Preliminary government data showed kerosene stocks in June amounted to 2.3 million kilolitres (kl), down about 23.7 percent from the same month last year.</p>
<p>&quot;Judging from the stock level, even if it turns out to be an average winter I think spot requirement for imported goods will be strong,&quot; one dealer with a trading company said.</p>
<p>But reduced crude throughput in Singapore has made it difficult for traders to judge the availability of oil products in the region for the coming months.</p>
<p>Three refiners in Singapore -- the local units of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group, Mobil Corp and Esso -- have cut production because of poor refining margins.  </p>
<p>Traders in Tokyo are concerned that a prolonged throughput cut in Singapore could lead to tighter supplies, consequently boosting the price of kerosene imports.</p>
<p>Most traders believe lower throughput in Singapore is likely to have an impact on market sentiment and Japanese refiners' plans for imports for the winter.</p>
<p>&quot;I think Singapore's going to have an impact (on the situation),&quot; one Japanese oil company trader said.</p>
<p>Industry figures show that Japan imported roughly 3.4 million kl of jet/kerosene in fiscal 1995/96, of which about one million kl came from Singapore.</p>
<p>&quot;We try to look for cargoes from Singapore (because of the geographical proximity),&quot; a trader with a Japanese oil refiner said.</p>
<p>Japanese oil refiners have been reluctant to increase domestic throughput for a number of reasons.</p>
<p>Higher throughput would yield a larger amount of a whole range of products, not all of which are in demand. And a surplus of products such as gas oil would undermine efforts to raise domestic wholesale prices.</p>
<p>Also, the extra storage costs would also burden oil companies which are struggling to cut expenses.  </p>
<p>Last winter, when most refiners kept crude runs low in an attempt to bolster domestic kerosene prices and cut storage costs, refiners imported 2.6 times more kerosene than in the previous year -- 1.98 million kl compared with 771,000 kl.</p>
<p>Traders said Japanese oil companies were still drafting and fine-tuning their plans for the winter, and details were likely to be clearer early next month.</p>
<p>A trader at another trading company said Japanese oil firms were comparing the cost involved in refining their own crude oil to produce kerosene with that of importing the product, adding that they would probably opt for the latter.</p>
<p>&quot;I think (any) increase in domestic refinery runs will be fairly small,&quot; he said.</p>
