<title>RUSSIA: Yeltsin back in Moscow after short break - spokesman.</title>
<headline>Yeltsin back in Moscow after short break - spokesman.</headline>
<dateline>MOSCOW 1996-08-22</dateline>

<p>Russian President Boris Yeltsin has returned to Moscow after a two-day break in northwestern Russia, his press office said.</p>
<p>&quot;The president returned late last night and is expected to work in the Kremlin today,&quot; a spokesman said. &quot;He will be working with documents and is also expected to meet some of the candidates to the still-vacant posts in the government.&quot;</p>
<p>Ekho Moskvy radio said the president's limousine had arrived at the Kremlin at around 9.30 a.m. (0530 GMT).</p>
<p>Yeltsin, 65, has been seen in public just once in seven weeks, at his August 9 inauguration for a second term in the Kremlin. But he looked tired and spoke in a flat, wooden voice, leading to speculation that he was ill.</p>
<p>Aides denied the speculation and dismissed a string of reports in Russian and Western media that Yeltsin had suffered a recurrence of heart problems which put him in hospital twice last year.</p>
<p>They have said the president is simply tired after a gruelling campaign for reelection.</p>
<p>Yeltsin left for a two-day trip to the Valdai lakelands of northwestern Russia on Tuesday and aides said he would decide during the visit whether to take a longer vacation there.</p>
<p>His absence coincided with a Russian military threat to launch an all-out assault on the separatist-held Chechen capital Grozny, raising questions about who was in charge of Russian policy there.</p>
