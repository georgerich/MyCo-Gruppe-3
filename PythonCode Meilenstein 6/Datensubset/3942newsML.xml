<p>European bourses kept their morning gains on Tuesday afternoon but fell into step with Wall Street, trading cautiously until the U.S. central bank's Federal Open Market Committee announces a decision on interest rates.</p>
<p>London shares had climbed to another record high earlier on Tuesday, led by renewed strength in retailing and oil stocks and following reassuring money supply data from both Britain and Germany.</p>
<p>The blue-chip FTSE 100 index peaked at 3,883.4, 5-1/2 points up on its previous record set on Monday, after British M4, the broad measure of money supply, showed money growth remained subdued through July.</p>
<p>Analysts said the money supply figures could give further ammunition to Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke if he wants to trim the 5.75 percent base interest rate again in coming months.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a good figure...most people hadn't expected the figure to come back into the monitoring range, which is about the first time for six or seven months,&quot; said economist Keith Wade of Schroders.</p>
<p>In Germany, growth in M3, the German central bank's main policy guide, slowed to an annualised 8.6 percent in July from 9.6 percent in June, virtually guaranteeing a cut in rates at Thursday's meeting of the Bundesbank council, analysts said.</p>
<p>The positive data failed to inspire the German stock market, which traded mixed, but economists welcomed the figure.</p>
<p>&quot;It is now very clear that we have a very good chance to reach the Bundesbank target zone (of four to seven percent growth for 1996). I think there is a very good chance that we will see a cut in the repo rate,&quot; said Uwe Angenendt, economist at BHF-Bank in Frankfurt.</p>
<p>The Paris bourse gained more than 30 points, quickly pushing the CAC-40 share index through the 2,000 barrier for the first time since August 8, on strengthened hopes of a new round of rate cuts.</p>
<p>The dollar held its gains after a lift from a narrowing U.S. June trade gap. The deficit was $8.11 billion against May's revised $10.55 billion shortfall.</p>
<p>But currency markets were still nervous ahead of news from the key U.S. and German central bank meetings -- on Tuesday and Thursday, respectively.</p>
<p>&quot;OK, so the Fed probably won't move and the Bundesbank probably will, particularly after that good M3 number. But in this market you will get killed if you're wrong and have a big position,&quot; said one trader. &quot;I'm not taking the risk.&quot;</p>
<p>CURRENCIES  AT 1415 GMT</p>
<p>Dollar/mark was trading at 1.4904 and dollar/yen at 108.32 versus Monday's late 1.4875 and 107.90. Mark/French franc was trading at 3.4159 against 3.4232.</p>
<p>STOCK MARKETS AT 1415 GMT</p>
<p>The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading British shares was up 16.5 points at 3,88.33. Frankfurt's 30-share DAX index was down 2.5 at 2,563.20. Paris's CAC-40 was up 31.26 at 2,017.47.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold fixed unchanged from the morning at $387.10 an ounce.</p>
<p>Silver was steady at $5.20, up eight cents, and platinum was $1.10 higher at $399.50.</p>
