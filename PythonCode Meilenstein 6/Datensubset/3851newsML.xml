<headline>World steel output down again in July - IISI.</headline>
<dateline>BRUSSELS 1996-08-20</dateline>

<p>World crude steel production fell 1.1 percent to 60 million tonnes in July compared with the same month last year, the International Iron and Steel Institute (IISI) said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>In the January-July period steel output in the 66 countries which report to the IISI fell by 1.9 percent to 423.4 million tonnes.</p>
<p>However, it signalled better times ahead in western Europe, saying major steel producers in the region were finally seeing the end of a long period of overstocking.</p>
<p>&quot;Western Europe's stock levels are finally being normalised, but summer shutdowns reflect negatively on the region's results,&quot; IISI said in a statement.</p>
<p>July production in western Europe declined by 6.8 percent to 12.5 million tonnes compared with the same 1995 month but IISI said big producers expected &quot;that production results should show more positive signs in the near future.&quot;</p>
<p>Production reports indicated continued growth in the United States and further growth also marked the month in South America, most of Asia and the Middle East, IISI said.</p>
<p>But July output fell 12 percent to 2.6 million tonnes in eastern Europe compared with last year. In the former Soviet Union, production declined by two percent to 6.5 million tonnes.</p>
<p>&quot;However, the production decline in Russia in July was considerably less dramatic than in earlier months at 4.1 million tonnes, it was down by only 1.3 percent from July 1995 production,&quot; IISI said.</p>
<p>In North America, output rose four percent to 10.2 million tonnes, &quot;confirming the region's growth trend,&quot; IISI said.</p>
<p>In the United States, output jumped five percent year-on-year to 7.9 million tonnes. &quot;Best U.S. steel industry customers in July were the automotive and construction sectors,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Output in Africa fell by three percent to 1.1 million tonnes while it soared 14.4 percent to 705,000 tonnes in the Middle East and rose by 1.2 percent in Asia to 22.4 million tonnes. Continued growth was registered in China, up 7.2 percent to 8.2 million tonnes compared with the same month last year.</p>
