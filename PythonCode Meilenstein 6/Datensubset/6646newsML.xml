<p>Maurice Saatchi, the advertising guru who has helped Britain's Conservative Party to win four successive general elections, is to be made a Lord on Prime Minister John Major's recommendation.</p>
<p>The granting of a life peerage to 50-year-old Saatchi just weeks after he produced a controversial poster featuring a picture of opposition Labour Party leader Tony Blair with demonic red eyes, looked set to cause a political storm.</p>
<p>Saatchi was among 14 people -- six Conservatives, six Labour members and two members of minority parties -- who Queen Elizabeth formally announced on Wednesday she planned to make members of the House of Lords.</p>
<p>Political sources said the list followed the nominations made by party leaders and was designed to replenish their forces in the unelected upper house of parliament.</p>
<p>Saatchi and his elder brother Charles helped Margaret Thatcher to win power in 1979 when their Saatchi and Saatchi agency produced a poster showing a huge queue of people at an employment exchange under the slogan &quot;Labour isn't working&quot;.</p>
<p>Their &quot;Labour's Tax Bombshell&quot; poster at the 1992 general election was widely credited with scaring enough middle-income voters away from the opposition party to give Major a wafer-thin majority of 21 seats in the lower House of Commons.</p>
<p>Maurice Saatchi was ousted from Saatchi and Saatchi in a shareholder revolt in 1994, and set up his own agency, M&amp;C Saatchi, which the Conservatives almost immediately switched to.</p>
<p>It is now working on a &quot;New Labour, New Danger&quot; campaign designed to convince voters that despite their dropping of traditional socialist dogma, the Conservatives' principal opponents cannot be trusted.</p>
<p>One poster in this campaign shows a picture of Blair with red eyes which critics have said makes him look like a devil.</p>
<p>After heavy criticism, the Conservatives withdrew this poster, now under investigation by the Advertising Standards Authority watchdog, but reserved the right to use it again.</p>
<p>Major also ennobled Peter Selwyn Gummer, another adviser to the Conservatives on brightening up their image. Gummer, brother of Environment Secretary John Gummer, is chairman of the Shandwick public relations company.</p>
<p>Labour's environment spokesman Frank Dobson said: &quot;Awarding peerages to Peter Gummer and Maurice Saatchi takes the Tory party and the peerage system to new depths.&quot;</p>
<p>Nominations for peerages have sparked political controversy in Britain for years.</p>
<p>Labour's Harold Wilson raised eyebrows when he made his private secretary Marcia Falkender a life peer on his retirement as prime minister in 1976.</p>
<p>David Lloyd George, a Liberal who headed a mainly-Conservative administration after World War One was prepared to sell peerages to almost anyone prepared to pay.</p>
