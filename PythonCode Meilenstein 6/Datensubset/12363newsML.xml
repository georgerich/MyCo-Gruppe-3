<title>CAMBODIA: Cambodian Supreme court fines and jails editor.</title>

<p>Cambodia's Supreme Court on Friday fined and jailed outspoken former editor Hen Vipheak on charges of spreading disinformation but allowed his paper to keep publishing.</p>
<p>Judge Chan Sok upheld rulings by the municipal and appeal courts that handed down a fine of five million riels (US$2,000) and one year's imprisonment, but he overturned a decision to shut down Hen Vipheak's newspaper, Sereipheap Thmei (New Liberty).</p>
<p>Police took Hen Vipheak to the capital's run-down T3 prison and he must now hope that co-Premiers Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen will support an amnesty promised earlier this year by King Norodom Sihanouk.</p>
<p>Hen Vipheak, a member of the opposition Khmer Nation Party (KNP), is the second journalist to be jailed under the coalition government formed in 1993.</p>
<p>Sihanouk offered an amnesty to fellow KNP member Chan Rattana, former editor of Voice of Khmer Youth, after he was jailed for a year in June for defaming the premiers. He was released a week later when Ranariddh and Hun Sen approved the amnesty.</p>
<p>The king had promised an amnesty to a third newsman, opposition publisher Thun Bunly, but he was shot dead in May before his case came to court and the KNP claimed the unsolved killing was politically motivated.</p>
<p>Judge Chan Sok ruled that a May 1995 article in Hen Vipheak's weekly paper, entitled &quot;Cambodia, the country of thieves&quot; and alleging top-level corruption, had insulted the country's leaders and the nation.</p>
<p>Hen Vipheak, whose newspaper office was attacked by alleged supporters of Hun Sen in October last year, argued that the article was legitimate opinion as it was a letter from a reader.</p>
<p>He issued a statement on Thursday predicting the Supreme Court would uphold the lower court decisions, including closure of the newspaper, &quot;as the plot to jail me had already been staged&quot;.</p>
<p>It said his detention and closure of the paper would &quot;show that those who are in power have moved another step towards the elimination of the freedom of expression guaranteed by the constitution...and by the Paris peace accords (of 1991).&quot;</p>
<p>The judge upstaged part of this prediction by allowing continued publication of the paper, one of a handful that reflect the views of the KNP, which is not recognised by the government.</p>
