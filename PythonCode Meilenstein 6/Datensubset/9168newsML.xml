<title>RUSSIA: Russian shares' rise to be short-lived.</title>
<headline>Russian shares' rise to be short-lived.</headline>

<p>Leading Russian shares rose on Thursday on news President Boris Yeltsin had returned to work to Moscow and progress in Chechnya talks, traders said.</p>
<p>They said they did not expect the rise to continue in the next few days.</p>
<p>The Russian Trading System index of 21 leading shares rose by 2.84 percent to 180.87.</p>
<p>&quot;In the morning the reports came that (General Alexander) Lebed cancelled bombing and Yeltsin returned to Moscow and was working. It gave a spur to the market,&quot; said Alexander Bobolev, a trader from IK Aton.</p>
<p>Russian television showed a brief clip of Yeltsin laughing and smiling as he spoke with new health minister Tatyana Dmitriyeva.</p>
<p>Talks between Lebed and Chechen separatist leaders were going well and the two sides were working out a detailed schedule on how to stop the war, Lebed said on Thursday.</p>
<p>But Yuri Agaronik, chief analyst from IK Prospekt, said charts were not pointing to a continuing advance in shares.</p>
<p>&quot;By technical analysis, we do not see any preconditions for the (falling) trend to change,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Agaronik said the decision by the International Monetary Fund to give Russia the delayed July tranche of its 10 billion loan had given another push up to the prices.</p>
<p>Prices rose on the political news in early trade, but sank later, only to recover in the evening, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think brokers were pushing up prices in speculative buying on the news about granting the credit and the improvement of the situation in Chechnya,&quot; Agaronik said. &quot;If there are more orders they will meet higher prices.&quot;</p>
<p>Mosenergo closed at $0.96 after $0.95 at Wednesday's close, LUKoil rose to $9.85 from $9.40, Norilsk Nickel edged up to $7.85 from $7.50 and UES was $0.0804 after $0.0765.</p>
