<p>Ecuador's Energy and Mines Minister Alfredo Adum Thursday accused Argentine-owned oil firm Maxus Energy Corp of cost over-runs and spoke of a possible &quot;malicious attitude&quot; of overpricing.</p>
<p>&quot;Maxus comes along, carries out an investment project for $300 million in a year. It turns out it wasn't $300 million, it had become $700 million,&quot; Adum told local television.</p>
<p>&quot;People say there was a malicious attitude of overpricing things ... all the equipment overpriced, on all the products, on all the constructions.&quot;  </p>
<p>Adum added: &quot;They began to extract oil and they took all the oil themselves and it was not enough to cover the costs of the goods they had constructed.&quot;</p>
<p>According to Adum, under Maxus's present oil contracts with the Ecuadoran government, the firm does not have to share its output with the state if its costs are high.</p>
<p>The government announced late Tuesday that it was banning the Dallas-based Maxus from continuing its operations in Ecuador until it reaches a joint-venture deal to share output with state-owned Petroecuador.</p>
<p>The owners of Maxus, Argentina's YPF SA, Wednesday said the Ecuadoran government had requested it to renegotiate its contracts. But it said its operations in Ecuador were functioning normally.</p>
