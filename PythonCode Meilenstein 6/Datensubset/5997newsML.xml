<p>Russia may export low quality feed wheat this year, fulfilling predictions by top agricultural officials, traders said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a possiblity of exports, but of not of high quality grain. It is a question of feed wheat,&quot; said a senior trader at a Western firm in Moscow.</p>
<p>Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Zaveryukha has said recently Russia could export about four to five million tonnes of grain and said on Tuesday that Russia was negotiating grain deals with Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan. He gave no details.</p>
<p>Traders said exports could range from as little as one million tonnes to more than five million tonnes, depending on the final outcome of the harvest which is still underway.</p>
<p>Russia's high quality wheat crop will only meet its own needs, traders say, and it may need to import some maize and soy meal feed grains, but the harvest will be relatively rich in feed wheat.</p>
<p>The government is forecasting a grain harvest of 77 million tonnes, above some independent estimates of 72-73 million, and says Russian imports and exports of grain will balance.</p>
<p>Traders named Russia's Commonwealth of Independent States neighbours as primary potential clients, especially Central Asian states but also Belarus and Ukraine, which could absorb small quantities.</p>
<p>Turkmenistan, Tajikistan and Azerbaijan, price-conscious buyers, are good potential customers of feed wheat, but Uzbekistan would look for higher quality supplies, said Igor Andreyev of trading company ZAO Eximkhleb.</p>
<p>One Russian trader said major grain regions Povolzhsk and North Caucasus, positioned relatively close to all the potential CIS clients, would be primary feed wheat sources.</p>
<p>Siberia would be able to sell only to Central Asia, because of high freight charges, he said.</p>
<p>Traders disagreed over the degree of competitiveness of Russian grain.</p>
<p>&quot;Russian wheat is more expensive than European, though if you add freight charges (to Central Asia), Russian wheat is a little cheaper,&quot; said Andreyev.</p>
<p>Other traders said feed wheat could be competitive with European prices and said deals could be happening already.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything will depend on the price,&quot; said the Western firm's senior trader.</p>
<p>Andreyev added that European traders can organise shipment faster, which puts Russia at a disadvantage with buyers needing grain quickly.</p>
<p>But grain analyst Andrei Sizov of SovEcon Ltd said Russian grain needs, including feed grains which would have to be supplemented by maize and soymeal imports, made exports extremely unlikely.</p>
<p>Traders who predicted exports disagreed on how and when they could happen, some saying buyers would wait until their own harvests finished, others saying talks could be happening now.</p>
<p>One Russian trader said as much as 60 to 70 percent of deals, which he predicted would be one to two million tonnes of feed wheat, total, could be brokered through former Soviet agencies such as Roskhleboprodukt.</p>
<p>Russia's neighbours may not have much cash to pay for grain, but Central Asian states could supply cotton through barter, which one trader said private firms would be more likely to broker.</p>
<p>&quot;If prices are good, the sales could start now,&quot; said one trader.</p>
