<headline>McDonnell says has no strike-related costs.</headline>

<p>McDonnell Douglas Corp said it has not shouldered any extraordinary expenses to maintain operations during an ongoing strike by machinists.</p>
<p>&quot;There are no extraordinary expenses due to this,&quot; McDonnell spokesman Tom Williams said.</p>
<p>Williams said 2,000 people have been hired as temporary replacements and another 3,000 or so white-collar workers are helping to maintain production.</p>
<p>Together, that number is less than the 6,400 members of the International Association of Machinists (IAM) who went on strike against McDonnell on June 5.  </p>
<p>In spite of the strike, there has been no effect on the quality or cost of military aircraft being produced, according to the U.S. Department of Defense.</p>
<p>The Defense Department responded to a request from George Kourpias, IAM international president, who wrote to the Clinton Administration seeking an audit of the production of fighter planes and weapons being built by replacement workers.</p>
<p>Defense officials said they found no production problems, adding McDonnell has not passed on any strike-related costs to the government.</p>
<p>Gay Maund, spokeswoman for the Defense Contract Management Command, said her agency stepped up oversight of McDonnell's quality, cost and safety immediately after the strike began.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not finding anything significant,&quot; Maund said.</p>
<p>She said output is reduced somewhat, and problems typical to any large manufacturing company have turned up. But she added that no serious problems have been uncovered.</p>
<p>The machinists and the company have not held talks since the IAM broke off negotiations August 16. No further negotiations have been scheduled.</p>
