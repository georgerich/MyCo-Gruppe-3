<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has assured Egypt he will start negotiations with the PLO soon, but a top Palestinian official said his policies meant there was no point holding talks.</p>
<p>Netanyahu's office said on Thursday that he &quot;informed President (Hosni) Mubarak about the track which is planned in the talks with the Palestinians which are to be opened in the very near future including via the steering committee.&quot;</p>
<p>Its statement said Netanyahu spoke to Mubarak by telephone but gave no date for a resumption of formal talks.</p>
<p>Netanyahu had apparently been shaken by Mubarak's remarks on Thursday in Alexandria suggesting that Cairo was having second thoughts about a Middle East economic summit it is scheduled to host in November if the peace process remained stalled.</p>
<p>The speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council and former top peace negotiator Ahmed Korei, also known as Abu Alaa, in remarks broadcast by Israel Channel One television, said Israel's present policies made negotiations an empty exercise.</p>
<p>&quot;First of all, if Israel continues with violations I do not see a benefit in negotiations...I do not want negotiations that cover the expansion of settlements,&quot; Korei said.</p>
<p>Netanyahu's government at the beginning of August lifted a freeze on Jewish settlement building imposed by the previous government in 1992 in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, where Palestinians hope one day to establish an independent state.</p>
<p>Still, Palestinian officials confirmed that Mahmoud Abbas, a senior PLO official also known as Abu Mazen, held talks with Netanyahu political adviser Dore Gold in Tel Aviv on Thursday.</p>
<p>They gave no details, but Israel's army radio said Gold and Abbas discussed a resumption of the steering committee talks.</p>
<p>Israel's Itim news agency said Netanyahu met Dan Shomron, the former army chief of staff who will head Israel's delegation on the committee, to discuss Israel's positions.</p>
<p>Israel's Channel Two television said Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy would go to Egypt soon but Israeli spokesmen were unavailable for comment. Egypt made peace with Israel in 1979 and has acted as a mediator in negotiations.</p>
<p>Netanyahu's message to Mubarak came several hours after Israel-PLO ties reached a crisis point over Israel's delaying for three hours a flight by Arafat to the West Bank where he had intended to meet former Israeli prime minister Shimon Peres.</p>
<p>In the end Arafat met Peres in the Gaza Strip self-rule enclave. To the Palestinians the delay was a capricious obstruction of Arafat's movement and a major violation of interim peace deals. Arafat cancelled an Israeli-PLO meeting on civilian affairs in protest.</p>
<p>At a joint news conference after their meeting, Arafat and Peres pledged to fight for the life of the peace deals they crafted along with Israel's former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, killed by a right-wing Jew in November.</p>
<p>Peres said: &quot;I feel deeply obliged that every promise we made on behalf of the (previous) government, on behalf of the Israeli people should be respected. If you replace rifles with words, words must be respected.&quot;</p>
<p>Netanyahu's defeat of Peres in May dismayed Palestinians, who in the historic 1993 PLO-Israel interim peace deal won limited self-rule on the West Bank and Gaza Strip and a commitment from Israel to negotiate a final peace.</p>
<p>Netanyahu opposes trading occupied land for peace and has so far refused to meet Arafat. He opposes a Palestinian state and has yet to carry out a redeployment of Israeli troops in the West Bank town of Hebron, part of a deal signed last September.</p>
