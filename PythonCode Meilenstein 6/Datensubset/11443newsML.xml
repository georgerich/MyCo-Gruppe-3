<p>Boxed beef trading for the week was steady to firm on light to moderate demand and offerings, USDA said. Retail and HRI demand was rather light for immediate needs. However, some improvement was noted on export demand. The higher cutout was inspired by improved seasonal demand for chuck and round cuts as these cuts traded higher throughout the week.</p>
<p>Rib and loin cuts were generally steady with a weak undertone noted on some loin cuts at the end of the trading period. Closely trimmed items traded higher on moderate demand with most of the advances in the chuck and round cuts.  </p>
<p>Beef trimmings traded higher early in the week and then supported that level for the remaining of the trading period. Fed cattle and blended coarse ground items continue to trend higher on firm holiday demand and mostly moderate offerings.</p>
<p>For the week - Select and Choice rib primal generally steady; Select and Choice chuck primal 2.00 to 6.00 higher; Select and Choice round primal 4.00 to 5.50 higher; Select and Choice loin primal steady to 1.00 lower; Closely trimmed items 2.00 to 3.00 higher; Beef trimmings 2.00 higher; Fed cattle and blended coarse ground items 1.00 to 5.00 higher.</p>

<p>COW AND BULL CARCASS, BONELESS PROCESSING BEEF, CUTTER COW CUTOUT Market activity on boneless beef was moderate early as many buyers sought thier needs at higher price levels. However, by mid-week prices stabilized and trading was slow. The cow carcasses market was higher this week in response to the strength in the boneless market. Cow cuts traded mostly steady for the week on light to moderate demand and moderate offerings, with some cuts making price adjustment.</p>
