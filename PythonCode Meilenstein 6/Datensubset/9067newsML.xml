<p>U.N. human rights monitors reported on Thursday a large rise in killings by &quot;state agents&quot; in Rwanda last month as the number of prisoners and detainees reached nearly 80,000.</p>
<p>The U.N. Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda said in July it received reports of killings of 365 people in 93 incidents, &quot;a very significant increase compared with...other months&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Of these, 220 occurred in Gisenyi prefecture, which has seen a marked rise in insurgency activity by infiltrators opposed to the government,&quot; said the monitors' monthly report.</p>
<p>It said anti-rebel operations by the government Rwanda Patriotic Army (RPA) accounted for 182 of the killings in July.</p>
<p>The Rwandan army says it is fighting Hutu rebels infiltrating from neighbouring Zaire. Human rights groups accuse the army and rebels of killing civilians in reprisal attacks.</p>
<p>Up to a million members of the Tutsi minority and allied Hutus were killed in genocide in Rwanda in 1994 by Hutu troops, militiamen and mobs. The rebels infiltrating into border regions of Rwanda are mostly former troops who fled to Zaire in 1994.</p>
<p>The U.N. human rights report said after an operation on July 9 and 10 it received names of 113 local people reported killed and 58 reported disappeared in two communes in Gisenyi and Ruhengeri prefectures.</p>
<p>&quot;The killings of 182 people represents a very subustantial increase in reported killings by state agents as compared to previous months,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>It said the population of 14 central prisons increased in July from 51,599 inmates to 52,678 in stark contrast with the official maximum capacity of the jails of 28,700 prisoners.</p>
<p>Rwandan troops arrest anyone suspected of involvement in the 1994 genocide and prisons have been filling since the end of the genocide in 1994.</p>
<p>&quot;The detainee population in 182 other centres was 25,832, and most were severely overcrowded. The total detainee population in Rwanda at the end of July was 78,510,&quot; the U.N. report said.</p>
<p>&quot;The increase of the detainee population intensified the problem of overcrowding,&quot; said the report, adding in some centres five prisoners were held in each square metre (1.19 square yards).</p>
<p>It said the human rights office in Rwanda continued to receive reports of ill-treatment in centres across Rwanda.</p>
<p>&quot;The most common reported illnesses continued to be malaria, dysentery and respiratory diseases, resulting often from HIV infection. Forty-two detainees died during July, 31 of illness,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The London-based human rights group Amnesty International said last week reprisal killings by Rwandan troops and rebels of civilians including women and children were rising in Rwanda.</p>
<p>In a report, Amnesty International said between April and July more than 650 civilians were killed in Rwanda including women, children and babies by troops and Hutu rebels.</p>
<p>&quot;The RPA appears to be using the 'need to fight the enemy' as a pretext for eliminating people whose presence or influence is perceived as a threat to the current government,&quot; it added.</p>
