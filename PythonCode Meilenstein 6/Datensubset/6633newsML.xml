<p>Analysts reacted positively to second quarter earnings reported by Nedlloyd on Wednesday, but said the transport group would continue to struggle in the second half of the year.</p>
<p>&quot;Most analysts must be positively surprised,&quot; said Corne Zandbergen, analyst at Generale Bank.</p>
<p>Nedlloyd reported a second quarter net profit from ordinary activities of 21 million guilders -- up three million from last year -- and a first half profit of six million. Most analysts had forecast the group would post a small loss.  </p>
<p>However, few analysts felt the slim first-half profit was satisfactory.</p>
<p>&quot;Compared to the sales figures, (the profit) is very marginal. In terms of capital employed, it's still close to zero,&quot; said Bert van Hoogenhuyze, analyst at Amstgeld.</p>
<p>Most analysts' attention was focused on the performance of the company's Ocean Shipping division, which posted a profit of 22 million guilders, including 16 million guilders in proceeds from the sale of ships.</p>
<p>&quot;Shipping always performs the worst or the best, so everyone looks at those figures first,&quot; said Zandbergen.  </p>
<p>Nedlloyd said freight rates were substantially lower than last year, but that cost cuts, a slight increase in volumes and a more profitable cargo mix had led to an improvement in the second quarter of this year compared with the first quarter.</p>
<p>Analysts said the continuing erosion of shipping tariffs may make further cost cutting at Nedlloyd essential.</p>
<p>&quot;There's still ample capacity available and a lot of competition on most of their routes,&quot; said Rene van Geffen, analyst at F. Van Lanschot Bankers.  </p>
<p>Analysts were lukewarm about Nedlloyd's European Transport and Distribution arm where the contrasting performance of various units resulted in a two million guilder rise in second quarter net profits to 10 million.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems for every good bit there's a bit that performs badly,&quot; said Van Hoogenhuyze.</p>
<p>An extraordinary gain of 247 million guilders on the sale of offshore drilling unit Neddrill was in line with expectations, but an additional gain of 26 million guilders -- a refund from the company's pension fund -- raised some eyebrows.</p>
