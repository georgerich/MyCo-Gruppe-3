<p>SIMEX Euroyen and Eurodollars futures were trapped in narrow range trade on Wednesday following an uninspiring Federal Reserve's decision overnight to leave rates steady, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;There was no fresh news to trade on. The Fed's decision to leave rates unchanged was widely expected and factored in by the market,&quot; a dealer with a European institution said.</p>
<p>The Fed's decision to leave rates unchanged Tuesday left the short-end of the Japanese yield curve unscathed, dealers said. They added it reinforced expectations that the Bank of Japan would not be compelled to hike rates in the near-term.  </p>
<p>After trading in a four-tick band, December Euroyen ended at 99.14 against its CME close at 99.15. Volume was extremely light, at 6,555 contracts.</p>
<p>Dealers said the market now looked towards August 28 Tankan for a reflection of Japan's economic health. Most dealers were expecting the Tankan to show a gradual improvement in the economy.</p>
<p>After briefly breaking its resistance at 121.00, September Japanese government bond (JGB) futures ended at 120.93, up 13 ticks from its previous close. Turnover was at 252 lots.  </p>
<p>Dealers said positive results from Japan's 10-year bond auction fuelled JGBs to its intraday high and short-covering provided a good support.</p>
<p>They added BOJ's operations reaffirmed its steady rate policy.</p>
<p>Eurodollar futures ended a day of lacklustre trade little changed from their IMM close.</p>
<p>December Eurodollars closed unchanged at 94.21 against their IMM settlement. March was at 94.10 against 94.11.</p>
