<p>Russia's new energy minister, Pyotr Rodionov, has gained a reputation as a hard man during a long career working for natural gas monopoly Gazprom.</p>
<p>&quot;He's been described as fairly tough,&quot; said MC Securities oil and gas analyst Stephen O'Sullivan. &quot;He clearly comes from the gas industry -- no one in the oil industry seems to know him.&quot;</p>
<p>President Boris Yeltsin signed a decree naming Rodionov as the new minister of fuel and energy, Russian news agencies on Thursday quoted the president's press service as saying.</p>
<p>Rodionov is currently a board member of RAO Gazprom and managing director of its St Petersburg subsidiary, Lentransgaz.</p>
<p>Lentransgaz last August reduced supplies to St Petersburg consumers who were behind on payment, Interfax news agency said, although it was not clear if Rodionov was responsible for the decision.</p>
<p>The 45-year-old engineer has worked at Lentransgaz practically all his adult life, was appointed to the Gazprom board in May and will work again for his former boss at Gazprom, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.</p>
<p>Rodionov, as chief executive of AO Lentransgaz, criticised the neighboring Baltic states last October for considering using Norwegian natural gas instead of Russian gas, calling it an uneconomical move, the Russian daily Sevodnya wrote.</p>
<p>&quot;It is interesting that he said it was economically unreasonable rather than unacceptable,&quot; O'Sullivan said.</p>
<p>But whether the ministry of fuel and energy will have significant influence under Rodionov is unclear.</p>
<p>&quot;The ministry of fuel and energy essentially does not have anything to do,&quot; a government source told Reuters recently.</p>
<p>Privatisation of the oil industry, the independence of Gazprom and the transfer of oil transport issue decisions to the federal energy commission have reduced the role of the ministry, the source said.</p>
<p>Former energy minister Yuri Shafranik may have chosen to run for political office rather than serve a second term as energy minister, the source added.</p>
<p>But O'Sullivan said Rodionov could play an important role in regulating the electricity industry, which is heavily dependent on natural gas.</p>
<p>&quot;The ministry could influence whether there is much competition in the industry... Changes in gas tariffs affect electricity rates,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Unified Energy System (UES), the national grid controller and major shareholder in all but one of Russia's local power companies, is a mini-ministry of its own with strong lobbying powers in Rodionov's new ministry.</p>
<p>Battling UES's appetite for control could be one of Rodionov's biggest jobs, if he decides to pursue it.</p>
<p>The fuel and energy ministry will play a role in oil and natural gas tariffs but the extent of the powers of Rodionov and his ministry is unclear and could depend in large part on Rodionov's former boss -- Chernomyrdin.</p>
