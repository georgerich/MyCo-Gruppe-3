<p>KCBT hard red winter wheat futures ended higher in a short-covering rally that was sparked by a surge in CBOT soybeans, soymeal and corn, traders said.</p>
<p>Traders said CBOT grains were boosted by talk of either Japanese or Chinese interest in soymeal, and by bullish reports emerging from the annual corn and soybean crop tour.</p>
<p>&quot;The meal pit took off. That sparked a short-covering rally in here late. Volumes were so light that we were able to come off our lows and end firm,&quot; a trader said. &quot;Otherwise this was a very dull session.&quot;</p>
<p>Wheat had been adrift at the midsession, pressured by dull exports and spillover weakness from CBOT soybeans and corn.</p>
<p>Traders said Refco bought at least 1.2 million December bushels. Farmers Commodities Corp. bear-spread 500,000 Dec/Sept at three cents per bushel, they said.</p>
<p>KCBT wheat ended steady to 3-1/2 cents per bushel higher, with Sept up two cents at $4.81-1/2. December gained 1-1/2 cents to end at $4.78 per bushel.</p>
