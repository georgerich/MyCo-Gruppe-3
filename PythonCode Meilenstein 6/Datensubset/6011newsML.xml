<p>Foreigners have started opening special rouble bank accounts allowing them to trade Russian government securities but they have not yet appeared in numbers sufficient to have an impact on the market, dealers said.</p>
<p>The market was thrown open to non-residents a week ago and subsequently they bid for a total of 500 billion roubles of the bills on Wednesday -- the first time they were able to enter under the new scheme. This comes against about 2.5 trillion roubles available to them.</p>
<p>The reasons for the slow start appear to be technical, rather than disappointment at the relatively low yield on offer.</p>
<p>One reason is that Russian banks are not ready for the scheme, and another is that potential investors are still not fully informed about the details, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;Most Russian banks authorised to work in this scheme are not yet ready to provide their clients with comprehensive information,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>The Russian central bank has allowed non-residents to open special rouble accounts at Russian banks, of which 21 have been authorised, from August 15.</p>
<p>They can use funds on these accounts to buy and sell GKO discount Treasury bills and OFZ interest-bearing government bonds at auction and in the secondary market.</p>
<p>There is no limit on the amount which can be repatriated from these accounts, but purchases of foreign currency must be made through forward deals or options with a term of at least three months, at rates influenced by the central bank, effectively limiting the dollar yield on T-bills to 19 percent.</p>
<p>Wednesday's auctions of four trillion roubles of three-month T-bills and 7.5 trillion roubles of six-month bills are the first open to foreigners under the new scheme.</p>
<p>An official in the securities department of International Moscow Bank (Mezhdunarodny Moskovsky Bank), one of the authorised institutions, said some questions about the forward deals had not yet been resolved.</p>
<p>For the time being the central bank is not publishing its forward rates for these deals, but advising banks individually.</p>
<p>But dealers said Western investors are willing to put money into Russia under the scheme, even though they are held up by the need to process document legally and are still analysing the risks.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a desire on the part of Western investors, and all London is ready to take part. I think that investments will be limited for now, but as soon as this preparatory stage is over the situation will change,&quot; said a trader at one of the authorised banks.</p>
<p>Some analysts had previously argued that the central bank's scheme offered an unattractive risk/return ratio to foreigners.</p>
<p>The effective yield is capped, but foreigners take on a counterparty risk by having to deal with Russian banks instead of directly with the central bank, as under a preliminary scheme introduced in February and ending next month.</p>
<p>But dealers said that actively trading securities in the secondary market, or using options rather than forwards, would allow non-residents to reap more than the 19 percent determined by the central bank.</p>
<p>&quot;Non-residents understand that, but something else bothers them. They don't fully understand how the scheme works and want to get legal advice about who they are exposed to,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
