<p>Sentiment was cheered on the industrial board as offshore and local buyers returned to the market on Thursday, while golds came under pressure throughout the day, ending softer.</p>
<p>At the official close, the industrial index had risen 89.2 points to 7.681.6, the gold index lost 22.6 points to 1,703.8 and the all share index lifted 58.2 points to 6,479.2.</p>
<p>Traders said industrials stole the limelight while golds lost all shine, pressured by an overnight fall in the gold price and a continued lack of interest.</p>
<p>They said a number of positive company results on Wednesday, including Liberty Life, had aided industrials, as had relative stability on the rand and bond market.</p>
<p>The market was expected to consolidate over the next few days after a sell-off earlier this week.</p>
<p>But some dealers cautioned that the correction on the industrial board did not mean negativity had abated completely and said and there was still a lot of underlying volatility.</p>
