<p>Profits at Dutch food and drinks firm BolsWessanen will have continued to fall in the first half of 1996, as poor management and difficult markets dogged the group, analysts predicted on Friday.</p>
<p>They expect the company to post first half net profits of between 65.5 and 71 million guilders on Wednesday, with a consensus forecast of 68.3 million.</p>
<p>The pessimistic outlook follows a profit warning by the group in May, when they predicted a 20-25 percent year-on-year fall in first half net from ordinary operations. The group posted an 87.9 million guilder profit in H1 1995.</p>
<p>Analysts agreed a change in management was necessary to put the group back on a growth course.</p>
<p>&quot;No-one is really looking for a forecast of substantially higher earnings, because of the poor credibility of the existing management. The best news would be a change in management,&quot; said Theodoor Gilissen analyst Derk Erdman.</p>
