<p>Asian stock markets were predominantly higher on Tuesday, but moves were muted and turnover poor as investors awaited fresh factors.</p>
<p>Potential new leads included the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting later on Tuesday, although markets have generally discounted any rate change.</p>
<p>Australian stocks ended just firmer as the unveiling of the Federal budget, which forecast an underlying budget deficit of A$5.65 billion for fiscal 1996/97, came too late to hit trading.</p>
<p>Tokyo stocks closed slightly higher, after drifting in tight ranges in mostly directionless trade for most of the day.</p>
<p>Investors remained on the sidelines, and brokers expected the sluggish trend to continue for a while.</p>
<p>The key 225-share Nikkei average ended up 20.60 points, or 0.10 percent, at 21,127.01. Its September futures gained 10 points to 21,180 by the end of the session.</p>
<p>&quot;The biggest reason why investors could not move was there were no factors to prompt fresh buying,&quot; said Kenzo Doi, senior analyst at Kokusai Securities Co Ltd.</p>
<p>A rally in the utilities sector lifted Hong Kong stocks to a higher close, with the Hang Seng index closing above 11,300 points for the first time since March.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng index ended 99.03 points higher at 11,312.51.</p>
<p>&quot;People are buying laggards. Most sectors have gained -- banks, properties, H-shares, red chips -- and now it is time for utilities which are still at a very low level,&quot; said Antony Mak, sales director at Vickers Ballas.</p>
<p>Brisk trading in second liners drove Singapore shares to close up. Sentiment was partly lifted by strong July trade figures.</p>
<p>The 30-share Straits Times Industrials Index was up 18.15 points at 2,123.81.</p>
<p>Taiwan share prices rebounded from an early slide to close slightly higher on news that China had issued rules governing direct shipping links with estranged Taiwan, brokers said.</p>
<p>The index ended up 9.93 points or 0.16 percent at 6,057.44.</p>
<p>The Australian share market ended just firmer and well off its highs as cautious players cashed in gains ahead of the Federal budget.</p>
<p>The All Ordinaries index ended up 3.2 points at 2,264.7.</p>
<p>Jakarta's composite index rose 2.53 points to 539.61 points on active buying in secondaries and selected heavyweights.</p>
<p>Thai stocks ended slightly higher after moving in negative territory for most of the session as a market support fund helped bolster the flagging bourse, brokers asid.</p>
<p>The SET index ended 3.93 points higher at 1,071.41 on a thin 2.4 billion baht.</p>
<p>The benchmark Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange's Composite Index ended at 1,105.44, up 2.08 points, after moving in a four-point range.</p>
<p>Among losing markets, Manila shares languished in negative territory and closed down 1.98 points at 3,090.69.</p>
<p>Seoul was also lower and ended at a 33-month low in slow trading as overall depression erased early selective buying of theme-backed small-sized shares, brokers said.</p>
<p>The composite stock index ended 6.61 points down at a provisional 793.91, the lowest closing since November 12, 1993.</p>
<p>Bombay shares rebounded 33.89 points, or 1.03 percent, to 3,315.38.</p>
<p>In late Tokyo trade, the dollar was at 107.87/92 yen and 1.4899/04 marks, against New York's Monday close of 107.77/84 yen and 1.4867/77 marks as players awaited the FOMC meeting.</p>
<p>On SIMEX, October Brent futures were last traded at $20.75, down ten cents from London's settlement on Monday.</p>
<p>Bullion ended at US$387.10/50 an ounce in Hong Kong, slightly up on Monday's New York's close of $386.90/387.40.</p>
