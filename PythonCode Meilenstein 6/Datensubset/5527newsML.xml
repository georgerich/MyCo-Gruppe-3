<p>Michigan became the 13th state to take the tobacco industry to court, filing a lawsuit on Wednesday seeking $14 billion in damages from major tobacco firms and their wholesale distributors.</p>
<p>Michigan Attorney General Frank Kelley said the suit, which names 28 separate defendants, sought $2 billion in restitution to the state for past smoking-related health care costs, $2 billion for future anticipated health care costs and $10 billion in punitive damages.</p>
<p>Kansas and Arizona filed lawsuits against major tobacco firms on Tuesday, and Oklahoma was expected to file a similar lawsuit sometime this week.</p>
<p>In Indianapolis, a jury was expected to begin deliberations on Wednesday or Thursday in the case of Richard Rogers, a lawyer who began smoking at age six and died of lung cancer at age 52. His widow and children are suing four tobacco companies for unspecified damaages.</p>
<p>Tobacco firms &quot;have harmed the public and they should pay for that harm,&quot; Kelley said in a statement.</p>
<p>The Michigan suit, filed in Ingham County Circuit Court in Lansing, also asks the court to order tobacco companies to:</p>
<p>-- Disclose all research information on the effects of smoking that relates to public health issues.</p>
<p>-- Fund a corrective public education campaign on the impact of smoking and nicotine addiction and fund smoking cessation programs.</p>
<p>-- Issue corrective statements on the health risks of smoking and stop advertising that targets children.</p>
<p>-- Pay civil penalties for violations of the Consumer Protection and Antitrust Reform Acts and pay reasonable attorney fees and costs.</p>
<p>&quot;Every year in Michigan, thousands of addicted smokers die from using tobacco company products precisely as the merchants of death have designed and intended for those products to be used,&quot; Kelley said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;Through a well-organized campaign of fraud, lies, intimidation and deception, the tobacco companies have avoided legal responsibility for engineering, manufacturing and selling the most deadly and harmful consumer product in history while reaping billions of dollars in profit,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The lawsuit cites the defendants for violations of Michigan's Consumer Protection Act, Antitrust Reform Act, and Social Welfare Act, in order to recover Medicaid and other costs.</p>
<p>Defendants named in the suit include: Philip Morris Cos. Inc. ; RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp.'s RJ Reynolds Tobacco Co.; Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp. and its parent, B.A.T Industries Plc ; Loews Corp.'s Lorillard Tobacco Co.; the Brooke Group Ltd.'s Liggett Group Inc.; UST Inc.'s United States Tobacco Co.; Hill and Knowlton Inc; Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ; The Council for Tobacco Research U.S.A. Inc; and the Tobacco Institute Inc., among others.</p>
