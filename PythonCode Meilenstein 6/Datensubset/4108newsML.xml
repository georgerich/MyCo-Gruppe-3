<p>Florida's unemployment rate edged up to 5.1 percent in July from 5 percent in June, the state Department of Labor and Employment Security said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The figures represent 359,000 jobless Floridians out of a civilian labor force of 6.99 million. The state added 176,500 jobs over the year, a gain of 3 percent, putting the nonfarm employment total at 6.08 million.</p>
<p>Services saw the biggest gains over the year, 86,800 jobs for a 4.2 percent growth rate. That growth rate has been declining since October, when it reached 7.3 percent.</p>
<p>Trade added 46,000 jobs over the year, with wholesale trade continuing to grow faster than retail trade.</p>
<p>Construction was unchanged, while manufacturing lost 3,400 jobs since last July. All of the manufacturing losses were in nondurable goods.</p>
<p>The transportation, communications and public utilities sector gained 9,100 jobs or 3 percent over the year. Finance, insurance and real estate added 8,500 jobs for a 2.2 percent yearly gain. Government added 21,500 jobs or 2.5 percent over the year.</p>
<p>All of Florida's metropolitan areas had over-the-year employment increases. The Tampa-St. Petersburg area gained the most jobs, 30,900, while Fort Lauderdale had the fastest job growth rate, 3.9 percent.</p>
<p>More than two-thirds of Florida's 67 counties had unemployment rates below both the state and national average in July. Lafayette County had the lowest unemployment rate, 2.2 percent, while Hendry had the highest, 24 percent.</p>
<p>Nationally, the employment rate was 5.4 percent for July, up from 5.3 perent in June. Florida's jobless rate has stayed below the national average for 15 of the last 17 months.</p>
