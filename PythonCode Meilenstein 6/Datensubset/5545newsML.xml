<p>The Money Magazine/ABC News consumer comfort index remained unchanged at -11 in the week ended August 18.</p>
<p>&quot;Americans gained some faith in their finances but lost some in the economy,&quot; said a report released with the index.</p>
<p>The survey, this time with 1,044 respondents, polls consumers nationwide about the national economy, their own finances and their willingness to spend money. The poll has a margin of error of plus/minus 3.5 percent.</p>
<p>Thirty-nine percent of respondents rated the economy positively, lowering the poll's economic index two points to -22.</p>
<p>Fifty-eight percent rated their own finances highly, and 36 percent said now is a good time to spend.</p>
<p>In a separate question, 25 percent of 486 likely voters said Presidential candidate Bob Dole's 15 percent tax cut proposal made them more likely to vote for him in November. Thirty-six percent said it makes them less likely to vote for Dole, and 28 percent said the proposal did not affect their voting plans.</p>
<p>The separate question had an error margin of plus/minus five percent, the report said.</p>
