<p>Tropical Storm Dolly headed toward Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula on Tuesday, dumping up to 10 inches (25 cm) of rain in its path, forecasters said.</p>
<p>They said Dolly was expected to spin over the Yucatan and into the Gulf of Mexico where it could increase to hurricane strength. If Dolly continued its current course and speed, it could threaten the Texas-Mexico border area near the Gulf Coast later this week.</p>
<p>At 7 a.m. EDT (1100 GMT), Dolly was 100 miles (160 km) west of the tourist resort of Cozumel, Mexico, with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (85 kmh). Its exact position was latitude 19.1 north and 86.6 west and it was moving west-northwest at 14 mph (25 kmh). A tropical storm warning was in effect from Belize north to Progreso, Mexico.</p>
<p>&quot;We think Dolly will come ashore in the Yucatan around noon,&quot; said National Hurricane Centre forecaster Mike Hopkins. &quot;There should be some storm surge flooding along the coast, a lot of rain and pretty strong winds.&quot;</p>
<p>Forecasters said they were keeping a close eye on the storm in case it strengthened into a hurricane, with winds of at least 74 mph (125 kmh). &quot;It's definitely within a realm of possibilities once it moves back into the Gulf of Mexico, where the water is warm. Anybody in the southern part of Texas should be paying attention to this storm,&quot; Hopkins said.</p>
