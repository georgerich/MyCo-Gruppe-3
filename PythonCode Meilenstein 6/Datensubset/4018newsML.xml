<p>Turkish security forces have killed 16 Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) rebels in separate clashes on the rugged border with northern Iraq, security officials said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The emergency rule governor's office in the southeastern city of Diyarbakir said the guerrillas were killed on Monday and Tuesday in the border province of Hakkari. One member of the security forces also died, the office said in a statement.</p>
<p>Suspected PKK fighters killed three civilians in an attack in central Turkey on Monday night, police said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Assailants opened fire on two cars on a lonely road in the central province of Sivas, killing two women and a two-year-old child, a police official said.</p>
<p>&quot;According to the information we have it was most probably the PKK,&quot; he told Reuters by telephone from Sivas.</p>
<p>The guerrillas killed a policeman and another person in an attack on an intercity bus in the same area last week. Sivas has only a small Kurdish population and is not one of the ten southeastern provinces under emergency rule where the rebels are most active.</p>
<p>But rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan warned last week that his forces would stage attacks on the periphery of the mainly Kurdish southeast to stretch security forces.</p>
<p>More than 20,000 people have been killed in 12 years of conflict between soldiers and rebels fighting for autonomy or independence.</p>
<p>The guerrillas damaged two government buildings in the town of Baskale, near the Iranian border, in a rocket attack on Monday night, Anatolian news agency said. No-one was injured.</p>
