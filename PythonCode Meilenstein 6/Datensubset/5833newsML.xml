<p>Nigeria is barring the lawyer for executed human rights activist Ken Saro-Wiwa from speaking at an international legal conference in Canada, officials said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Olisa Agbakoba, who represented Saro-Wiwa and eight other Nigerian minority rights activists, planned to speak on Aug. 29 at the Commonwealth Law Conference in Vancouver. About 2,300 judges, lawyers and justice officials from Commonwealth countries were scheduled to attend the event.</p>
<p>But the Canadian ministry of foreign affairs said the Nigerian government had refused to give Agbakoba his passport so he could travel to the conference. &quot;Our understanding was that he was not able to obtain his passport, that it was being withheld,&quot; ministry spokesman Rodney Moore said in Ottawa.</p>
<p>Canadian diplomats have raised the issue with government officials in Nigeria, stressing that Canada would welcome Agbakoba's visit &quot;on the basis he is such a distinguished person,&quot; Moore said. He said Canada hoped Nigeria would change its position but it appeared unlikely this would happen in time for Agbakoba's scheduled appearance in Vancouver.</p>
<p>Kathleen Keating, a Canadian lawyer who will co-chair next week's conference, said Agbakoba was &quot;definitely being stopped from leaving the country to speak on human rights issues. It has happened to him before. ... I don't have any expectation that he is going to be able to come,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Keating said the executive director of Nigeria's Civil Liberties Organisation, Abdul Oroh, hoped to stand in for Agbakoba at the meeting, but it was unclear whether he would be allowed to leave Nigeria either.</p>
<p>Oroh told the Vancouver Sun newspaper from Lagos that the Nigerian government had denied Agbakoba's repeated requests for a passport to attend the conference.</p>
<p>Nigeria was suspended last year from the Commonwealth, which groups 56 nations with links to Britain, after the executions of Saro-Wiwa and the eight other activists. The executions sparked international condemnation of Nigeria, which has been in crisis since the army annulled a 1993 presidential vote meant to end military rule.</p>
<p>Officials at Nigeria's High Commission in Ottawa were not available for comment.</p>
<p>The main powers in the Commonwealth group are Britain, Canada, New Zealand and Australia.</p>
