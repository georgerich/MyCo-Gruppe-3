<p>Crude tanker chartering in the all important Middle East Gulf slowed slightly on Friday after strong activity midweek. Rates held steady. Other sectors also saw unchanged freight rates.</p>
<p>Although no ULCC charters were seen out of the Middle East three VLCCs found employment both to Thailand. Bangchak was seen fixing a 230,000 tonne cargo on the Leonidas at W60, whilst Petroleum Thailand took an identically sized cargo on the Moscliff, also at W60.</p>
<p>The third VLCC fixed out region was 270,000 tonne cargo on the Sea Lord, chartered by Shell South Africa at W65.  </p>
<p>Shipping brokers said VLCC rates eastwards were steady, around W65 and a touch firmer to Japan.</p>
<p>&quot;Rates for the AG-Japan market have risen ever so slightly by three points or so, to around W70,&quot; said one.</p>
<p>Tankers bound for the U.S and Europe were assessed around W57-60.</p>
<p>In the Mediterranean chartering consolidated on yesterday's upturn. But, despite the increase in business 80,000 tonners making cross Med trips was still restricted to W100-102.5</p>
<p>In the inter-UKC sector rates on 80,000 tonners were steady around W100 although up to W102 was done.  </p>
<p>U.S. refiner Bayway fixed the Tromso Reliance at W85 to carry 140,000 tonnes out of Mongstad for New York.</p>
<p>The Caribbean market saw rates settle around last done levels, shipping brokers said. Brokers said 70,000 tonners travelling up the U.S. coast were steady around W130.</p>
<p>West African chartering was restricted to Suezmaxes where rates to the U.S. were put around W85-87.5. No VLCCs were done, but brokers said rates would be around W65.</p>
