<p>U.S. sugar imports are likely to run at 2.5 million tonnes per year for the rest of this decade, and up to three million annually through 2006, Agriculture Department analyst Edmund Missiaen said Wednesday.</p>
<p>In a speech to the International Sugar Symposium, Missiaen said U.S. sugar production would grow slowly over the next decade, reaching about eight million short tons by 2006. By comparison, output this year was forecast at seven million.  </p>
<p>Another speaker, Patrick Henneberry of Louis Dreyfus Sugar Co, said world sugar prices were likely to run in the range of 10 cents per lb to 12 or 12.5 cents during the coming year unless crop prospects improved markedly.</p>
<p>White sugar was likely to be in surplus, he said, while raw sugar supplies would be tight.</p>
<p>The Helms-Burton law on trade with Cuba may disrupt some of the traditional marketings of Cuban sugar, Henneberry said.</p>
<p>Overall, global sugar production would be roughly in balance with demand.  </p>
<p>USDA has proposed a sugar import quota of 2.475 million tonnes for fiscal 1997, beginning October 1 this year.</p>
<p>Missiaen said U.S. consumption of sugar would rise slowly in coming years, helping to constrain growth in U.S. output.</p>
<p>Sugarbeet production may grow somewhat in Michigan, Minnesota, North Dakota and the Pacific Northwest, he said. Sugarcane acreage in Louisiana was projected up by 10-to-20 percent, but acreage would decline in Hawaii and Florida.</p>
<p>Ten years from now, beet sugar production was likely to total 4.6 million short tons, Missiaen said, and cane sugar production would be about 3.4 million tons.</p>
<p>He said sugar output would not be depressed by enactment of the &quot;Freedom to Farm&quot; law which effectively reduced support prices and removed domestic marketing controls.</p>
<p>In sizing up the 1996/97 world sugar crop, Henneberry said Ukrainian and Russian production might be 1.4 million tonnes lower than the preceding year, Poland might export 250,000 tonnes, China may import more than two million tonnes, and India, despite a sharp drop in production, could export as much as two million tonnes.</p>
<p>Logistical constraints would probably limit India's exports to one to 1.5 million tonnes, though.</p>
