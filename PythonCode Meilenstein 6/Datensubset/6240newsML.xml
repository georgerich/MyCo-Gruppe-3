<p>A court in China sentenced two people to jail for forcing a mentally ill man to sell his blood and then taking his money, the Economic Daily said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>A People's Court in Zhumadian city in the central province of Henan meted out jail terms of 15 and 10 years to 41-year-old Zheng Zhendong and his 38-year-old girlfriend Hou Jianhui for forcing the man to give blood.</p>
<p>From early February to mid-March, they forced Lei Douliang to give blood repeatedly, in one case causing him to faint, and threatened to beat him if he resisted, it said.</p>
<p>The newspaper said the two took advantage of Lei, who was in good physical health but unable to understand that his blood was being sold. The two kept the money and that constituted robbery, the court said.</p>
