<p>A Polish schoolgirl blackmailed two women with anonymous letters threatening death and later explained that she needed money for textbooks, police said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;The 13-year-old girl tried to extract 60 and 70 zlotys ($22 and $26) from two residents of Sierakowice by threatening to take their lives,&quot; a police spokesman said in the nearby northern city of Gdansk on Thursday.</p>
<p>He said the women reported the blackmail letters and police caught the girl on Wednesday as she tried to pick up the cash at the Sierakowice railway station.</p>
<p>&quot;Interviewed in the presence of a psychologist, she said she wanted to use the money for school books and clothes,&quot; spokesman Kazimierz Socha told Reuters.</p>
<p>He said the case of the girl, from a poor family that had never been in trouble with the law, would go before a special court dealing with underage offenders.</p>
