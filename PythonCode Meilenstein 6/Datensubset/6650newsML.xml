<p>Turnover was solid on the white sugar futures market on Wednesday but price movements remained slight as raw sugar futures failed to give direction to London, traders said.</p>
<p>Activity was broadly confined to the front three positions with outright purchases peppered with switches and crosses seen from brokerages.</p>
<p>By 1519 GMT overall volume totalled 1,806 lots, with the bulk coming from the spot October contract at 1,318 lots.</p>
<p>Most positions weakened slightly after the New York opening and nearby white sugar spreads remained relatively steady.</p>
<p>October was down 80 cents at $352.50 after moving in a $3.00 range and December down 80 cents at $346.00.</p>
<p>Earlier in the session, buying from one leading commission house boosted October's value to its life-high of $355.50 before values slipped back. Traders said a fund might have been behind the buy orders.</p>
<p>The same house then sold October positions for a different client, traders said.</p>
<p>By testing resistance at the high, October has now come full circle on the charts after slumping to score two spike lows either side of $340.</p>
<p>In physical news, Algeria was said to be in the market on Wednesday to buy one cargo of 45 ICUMSA white sugar, most likely for prompt arrival.</p>
<p>Traders said no deal had so far been struck as a result of Algeria's weekend tender to buy between 12,000 and 14,000 tonnes of 100 or 150 ICUMSA sugars for October delivery.</p>
<p>Movements were also marginal in Paris where 733 lots were traded on the Matif exchange. October was up just 10 cents at $353.10 and December down 50 cents at $347.00.</p>
