<p>Boris Yeltsin will return to the Moscow area on Wednesday from a trip to Russia's northwestern lakeland and will be back at work in the Kremlin on Thursday, Interfax news agency quoted a source close to the president as saying.</p>
<p>A Kremlin spokesman said he could not confirm the report. &quot;We do not have this information,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The source told Interfax that Yeltsin would be working on documents and did not rule out that he might meet some candidates for ministerial posts that have yet to be filled in Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's new government.</p>
<p>Yeltsin's spokesman said on Tuesday that the president had left Moscow for a two-day trip to the Valdai region to look into whether he wanted to spend a longer holiday there.</p>
<p>The Kremlin has denied reports that president, who has been seen just once in public since being re-elected on July 3, is suffering a recurrence of the heart trouble that put him in hospital twice last year.</p>
<p>In Yeltsin's absence, Russian policy on the Chechen crisis has seemed confused, with some senior figures holding peace talks and army generals preparing to bomb Grozny. In the latest twist, Defence Minister Igor Rodionov disowned the bombing threat made by the army commander in the region.</p>
