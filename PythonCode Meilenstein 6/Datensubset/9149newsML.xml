<p>A group of leading Yugoslav economists on Thursday said government control in services prices could ease August inflation back to 3.0 percent.</p>
<p>The economists blamed a huge hike in the price of government services for boosting July inflation to what they saw as an alarming rate of 6.6 percent.</p>
<p>According to the Statistics Office, government services rose an average of 10.4 percent in July, aiding a surge above the previous month's 3.3-percent inflation rate.</p>
<p>&quot;Therefore, we suggest that the government abstain from any further price increases in services,&quot; said Miroljub Labus, a chief economist at the Belgrade-based Economic Institute.</p>
<p>The Institute said the price of services, including those controlled by the state, climbed 114.2 percent from January to July.</p>
<p>In the same period, consumer prices rose by 28 percent and industrial goods by 26.7 percent. No separate figures were available for state-supplied services.</p>
<p>&quot;(Monthly) inflation must not enter double digits. The government must try to keep the dinar exchange rate stable and retain both fiscal and monetary stability,&quot; said Jurij Bajec, another member of the Institute and a professor at the Belgrade School of Economics.</p>
