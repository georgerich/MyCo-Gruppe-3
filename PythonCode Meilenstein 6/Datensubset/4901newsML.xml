<p>German money supply growth continued to slow in July on average after slowing in April and June, the Bundesbank said in a statement, citing annualised M3 growth at 8.6 percent in July after 9.6 percent in June.</p>
<p>The central bank said that July growth was dampened by public sector cash positions but that bank lending to the private sector had picked up again after a weak June.</p>
<p>Monetary capital formation, the process by which funds are transferred to longer-term investments not included in M3, also slowed, the Bundesbank said.  </p>
<p>Non-banks reduced their holdings of money market fund certificates in July while standard savings deposits with three-month notice period grew &quot;fairly strongly,&quot; the Bundesbank said in a statement.</p>
<p>But short-term deposits again fell markedly, the Bundesbank added.</p>
<p>&quot;Bank lending to domestic companies and private individuals picked up again in July after being very weak in the previous month,&quot; the Bundesbank said.</p>
<p>But bank lending growth in July was not as strong as in the intitial months of the year, it added.</p>
<p>The expansion of long-term bank lending accelerated in July compared with June and May. But short-term business loans fell in July.</p>
