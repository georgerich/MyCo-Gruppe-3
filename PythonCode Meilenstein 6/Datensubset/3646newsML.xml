<p>World arms sales dropped in 1995 to their lowest level since the Cold War but Russia's rose sharply in its effort to get cash, according to a Congressional Research Service study released on Tuesday.</p>
<p>It said arms sales worldwide dropped to $28.8 billion last year from $40 billion after the 1991 Gulf War.</p>
<p>But it said Russia's weapons sales rose from $3.8 billion in 1994 to $9.1 billion last year because &quot;now Russia actively seeks to sell weapons as a means of obtaining hard currency.&quot;</p>
<p>It said Russia's most important customer was China, which has bought Russian S7-27 fighter planes and Kilo class attack submarines since 1994. Iran, which was a major buyer of Russian fighter planes, T-72 tanks and Kilo submarines earlier, had not been a major customer recently because of its own economic problems, the report said.</p>
<p>It said the United States was the second-biggest arms seller in 1995 at $8.2 billion, down from $12.8 billion the year before. But it said the United States was the biggest arms seller for the longer periods of 1992-1995 at $69 billion and 1988-1991 at $65.9 billion.</p>
<p>The report said France was the third-biggest arms seller last year with $2.7 billion in sales, down from $8.9 billion the year before.</p>
<p>It said Britain sold $500 million worth of weapons to developing countries last year compared to $714 million in 1994; Italy $800 million last year, up from $200 million, and Germany $300 million last year from almost none the year before.</p>
<p>The Congressional Research Service is in the Library of Congress and does research reports for congressional committees as well as members of Congress.</p>
