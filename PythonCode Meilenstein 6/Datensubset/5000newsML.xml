<p>India does not expect its opposition to a global nuclear test ban treaty to damage economic relations with the rest of the world, Finance Minister P. Chidambaram said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;I have been assured we don't expect any economic fallout and hope there would not be any economic fallout,&quot; Chidambaram told reporters in the Indian capital.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, India prevented the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) from being adopted at disarmament talks in Geneva.</p>
<p>The treaty, which supporters would like to forward to the United Nations General Assembly over India's objections, includes a clause which could provide for eventual, unspecified measures to encourage countries to ratify the pact.</p>
<p>India has expressed concern that the measures could involve punitive sanctions aimed at forcing it to approve the treaty.</p>
<p>The United States has reassured New Delhi that it would not be punished for opposing the CTBT, but India has said Washington's unilateral assurances did not allay its concerns because the disarmament talks involved many countries.</p>
<p>Foreign diplomats in New Delhi have said that while the measures might not involve punitive sanctions, countries that support the CTBT might lose confidence in India due to its stance in Geneva.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda reaffirmed the country's commitment to nuclear disarmament, vowing not to be a party to any &quot;discriminatory&quot; goals along the way.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe nuclear disarmament is vital for the future of humanity and would like to work towards this goal. However, till the goal is accepted by all, we cannot afford to subscribe to any goal that is discriminatory, unfair and inimical to national security interests,&quot; Deve Gowda told a gathering of scientists.</p>
<p>All major Indian political parties oppose the CTBT, and opinion polls show there is broad public support for the government's policy of retaining the option to test and deploy nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>India exploded a nuclear device in 1974 but says it has never built the bomb.</p>
<p>Experts say both India and Pakistan, which have fought three wars since independence in 1947, could quickly assemble a nuclear bomb.</p>
