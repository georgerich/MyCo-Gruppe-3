<title>SWEDEN: MoDo profits tumble on weak markets.</title>
<headline>MoDo profits tumble on weak markets.</headline>
<dateline>STOCKHOLM, Sweden</dateline>
<text>
<p>Swedish forestry group MoDo AB Wednesday reported sharply lower first-half profits due to weakness in its main markets except for newsprint.</p>
<p>First-half profit after financial items slid 36 percent to 1.66 billion crowns ($251.7 million) from 2.61 billion ($395.8 million). MoDo said currency hedging had improved its result by 948 million crowns ($143.7 million).</p>
<p>Analysts had expected a profit of about 1.44 billion crowns ($218.3 million), and MoDo's shares rose in Stockholm after the news, touching a peak of 188.00 crowns ($28.50) before trading up 4.0 (60 cents) at 185.00 crowns ($28.05).</p>
<p>&quot;The market for pulp, paper and paperboard during the first half of the year was influenced by the general economic slowdown and the current process of destocking in Europe,&quot; MoDo said in the results statement.</p>
<p>&quot;However, the order intake for pulp and paper -- for which price increases have been announced -- as well as for paperboard, improved during the second quarter,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Total first-half sales edged down to 10.22 billion crowns ($155.0 million) from 11.61 billion ($176.0 million), as paper, paperboard and pulp deliveries fell 10 percent from the 1995 period to 1.3 million metric tons.</p>
<p>&quot;Compared with the first quarter of 1996, second quarter delivery volumes were up by 88,000 (metric) tons,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Fine paper deliveries in western Europe fell 9 percent in the first half with uncoated grades falling 11 percent. But MoDo said orderbooks at its fine paper mills were now &quot;back to normal&quot; and second-quarter deliveries rose 6 percent compared with the first-quarter.</p>
<p>&quot;The fine paper stocks held by distributors and customers are now estimated to be low,&quot; MoDo said. It added that fine paper prices had stabilised and it had announced price increases of some 10 percent to take effect in September.</p>
