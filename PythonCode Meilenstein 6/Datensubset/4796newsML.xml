<p>A Hong Kong dimsum cook has told a court he chopped up his temptress boss into 11 pieces after she stripped off her clothes in his bedroom and tried to seduce him.</p>
<p>Zeng Liangxin, a 31-year-old worker imported from China who went on trial for the murder on Monday, told the court he killed the woman because he feared she would accuse him of rape after he had spurned her, the South China Morning Post newspaper said.</p>
<p>He decapitated the body and carved it into chunks that he threw into a river, he told Monday's hearing.</p>
<p>But he slept with her legs that night after becoming too exhausted with the grisly task and fearing that he would be spotted if he made too many trips with the dismembered body.</p>
<p>He dumped the legs the next morning, he said.</p>
<p>Zeng is a specialist in dimsum, a style of Chinese teahouse snacks popular among the local Cantonese population as well as in Chinatowns overseas.</p>
