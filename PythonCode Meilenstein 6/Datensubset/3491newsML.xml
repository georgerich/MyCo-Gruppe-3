<p>Australian Treasurer Peter Costello's Tuesday budget implements measures that boost the bottom line by A$3.9 billion in 1996/97, rising to A$7.2 billion in the following fiscal year.</p>
<p>The budget contains no major fiscal surprises. Every big measure has been announced prior to the budget or widely leaked.</p>
<p>With an estimated no-policy-change starting point of A$9.6 billion, this year's measures are projected to produce a A$5.6 billion underlying budget deficit -- that is, without asset sales.  </p>
<p>That deficit will fall to just A$1.5 billion in the following year and turn into the promised underlying surplus in 1998/99, even without the full A$8 billion in cuts that the government has foreshadowed since March, the budget papers show.</p>
<p>Asset sales will keep the headline balance in surplus throughout the four-year period covered by the forward estimates. This year's headline surplus is A$474 million.</p>
<p>The measures appear overwhelmingly on the revenue side: many major items accompanied by a thousand and one little cuts. Gross spending cuts save A$4.4 billion in 1996/97, more than the gross value of all measures.  </p>
<p>But there is also extra spending, mostly to fulfill promises made in the campaign for the March 2 election. In net terms, spending falls by only A$2.9 billion in 1996/97, still contributing the bulk of the savings.</p>
<p>The spending cuts really kick in during 1997/98, when A$5.2 billion is saved despite the extra spending.</p>
<p>(Accompanying reports itemise spending and revenue measures.)</p>
<p>The biggest single spending cut is on labour market programmes, essentially cancelling the Working Nation funding that the former government announced two years ago.  </p>
<p>But the measure has little long term effect. It will save A$575 million this year and A$1.0 billion next year, but the Working Nation funding did not go beyond then and the savings evaporate.</p>
<p>The revenue side -- which is vulnerable to parliamentary obstruction -- is more modest: a net gain of A$1.0 billion in 1996/97 rising to A$2.0 billion in the following year.</p>
<p>Again, more substantial revenue gains are offset by sacrifices to meet election commitments.</p>
<p>In one respect, the figures are better than they appear.  </p>
<p>The big A$800-million-a-year crackdown on wealthy tax avoiders -- announced by the former government in February -- has collapsed to an estimated revenue gain of just A$100 million in 1997/98.</p>
<p>The tax office does not know how much can be gained after that and so the forward estimates do not allow for it.</p>
<p>Also, the forward estimates still allow for the government's superannuation co-payment, a public contribution to workers' retirement savings that the former Labor government announced last year.  </p>
<p>This item is still budgeted as costing A$1.1 billion in 1998/99, the year that the budget moves into surplus. The following year the superannuation contribution costs A$2.4 billion, with the budget in a bigger surplus.</p>
<p>Revenue from asset sales, a major difference between the headline and underlying deficits, is estimated at A$5.1 billion in 1996/97, mostly proceeds from the Commonwealth Bank of Australia and some of the government's airport portfolio.</p>
