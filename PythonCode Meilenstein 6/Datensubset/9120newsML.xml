<p>Russian security chief Alexander Lebed met separatists in a Chechen rebel-held village on Thursday and their talks were said to be going well after a deadline for a Russian assault on Grozny passed quietly.</p>
<p>Lebed held his second day of talks as it became clear Russian generals had not carried out their threat to bombard the Chechen capital, held by rebels for more than two weeks.</p>
<p>Pounded by Moscow's forces on Wednesday, there was no sign of major military activity in Grozny in the morning and talks in the village of Novye Atagi, some 20 km (12 miles) to the south of the capital, were said to be progressing briskly.</p>
<p>Lebed's press spokesman Alexander Barkhatov told reporters the two sides were working out a &quot;day-by-day schedule&quot; to stop fighting which has raged on and off for more than 20 months.</p>
<p>&quot;The talks are being conducted in a good atmosphere,&quot; he said. &quot;A document will be completed in an hour's time.&quot;</p>
<p>More than 30,000 people have been killed in the North Caucasus region since President Boris Yeltsin sent his forces to crush its independence drive in December 1994.</p>
<p>The latest fighting has killed many hundreds and sent tens of thousands fleeing, especially after a Russian commander gave civilians 48 hours to get out before the attack due on Thursday.</p>
<p>Lebed said he had halted the attack after 11th-hour talks with rebel leaders on Wednesday night. But the generals in the field have had clear differences with Yeltsin's security adviser as well as with their own defence minister.</p>
<p>Explosions occasionally echoed across the countryside around Grozny, but they were far fewer than on Wednesday, when a sporadic air and artillery bombardment went on for hours.</p>
<p>Itar-Tass news agency said six Russian servicemen had been killed in the city overnight, but no casualty figures were available for the rebels who control most of the town or for the civilians cowering in cellars to escape the fighting.</p>
<p>The Red Cross estimated on Wednesday that about 120,000 were left in Grozny. A similar number had fled in the last two weeks.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, target of speculation over his health as factions vie for position over Chechnya, returned to the Kremlin on Thursday after a brief break and met his new health minister.</p>
<p>Lebed returned to the same southern Chechen village where he had talks the previous night and promised to try to end the conflict and agree the status of demilitarised city for Grozny.</p>
<p>&quot;We will today try to stop the war,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have gathered here with the firm intention of achieving something worthwhile. We are going to discuss the issues of how to separate the troops and give Grozny the status of a demilitarised city.&quot;</p>
<p>Lebed said on Wednesday he had agreed a ceasefire with rebel chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov and declared that the Russian military's threat to flatten Grozny would not happen.</p>
<p>He described the military ultimatum as a &quot;bad joke&quot; and assured Maskhadov late on Wednesday there would be no bombing.</p>
<p>The Russian military, humiliated by the separatists' takeover of Grozny on August 6, had accused the rebels of using a previous ceasefire to strengthen positions.</p>
<p>Truces have come and gone in Chechnya, and with Russia's chain of command looking tangled this week, it may yet be some time before Grozny can be sure Lebed is as good as his word.</p>
