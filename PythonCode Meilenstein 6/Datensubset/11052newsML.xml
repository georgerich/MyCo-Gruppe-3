<p>Leading Russian shares closed mixed on Friday and traders said they were waiting for foreign investors to define the trend for the next week.</p>
<p>Some investors were encouraged that an escalation in violence in Chechnya seemed to have been averted, dealers said.</p>
<p>The RTS-21 index edged up 0.67 percent to 182.07.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is firmer today, but we have not seen flows from the West yet to substantiate these prices,&quot; said Nick Mokhoff, chief trader from Alliance-Menatep. &quot;Hopefully next week we shall see some of these flows.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the market had firmed on news that a new ceasefire had been reached in Chechnya.</p>
<p>He also said that falling inflation rates had a positive impact on the share market.</p>
<p>Russian consumer prices fell 0.1 percent in the week to August 19 and if current trend continue August could be the first inflation-free month since 1992, the State Statistics Committee said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;All the indicators look very positive for Russia,&quot; Mokhoff said.</p>
<p>But he said it was still unclear how foreign investors would react.</p>
<p>&quot;The most important thing right now is to see whether the West reacts well and whether the flows start going our way,&quot; Mokhoff said.</p>
<p>Andrei Galperin, a trader from Creditanalstalt-Grant, said prices would not fall any further.</p>
<p>&quot;There is nowhere for the market to fall, as it has already corrected,&quot; he said. &quot;There are quite a lot of domestic investors who buy at any decline in prices.&quot;</p>
<p>Mosenergo was traded at $0.97 at $0.960 at Thursday's close, UES rose to $0.0810 from $0.0804, LUKoil rose to $9.97 from $9.85 and Norilsk Nickel fell to $7.70 from $7.85.</p>
