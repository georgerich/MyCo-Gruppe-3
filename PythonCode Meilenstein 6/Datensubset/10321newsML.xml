<p>A Chinese appeals court, in a rare move, sharply reduced on Friday to five years a prison sentence for an International Monetary Fund (IMF) employee accused of corruption.</p>
<p>The court's decision followed a brief suspension of technical assistance by the IMF and a Beijing visit by IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus to voice concern over what he described as judicial shortcomings in the case.</p>
<p>The Beijing Municipal Higher People's Court sentenced Hong Yang, 44, a Chinese national, to five years in prison for accepting bribes totalling 100,000 yuan ($12,000) in 1993, before he joined the IMF, the Xinhua news agency said.</p>
<p>&quot;The sentence was dealt with leniently... and according to law,&quot; Xinhua quoting the court as saying on Friday.</p>
<p>Hong, a former employee of the People's Bank of China, or central bank, was arrested in December while on an IMF mission to China. He was found guilty on June 28.</p>
<p>Beijing sources said the original sentence was for 10 years, although statements by the IMF in Washington put it at 11 years. Hong appealed.</p>
<p>Chinese courts rarely cut sentences on appeal, though an admission of guilt may lead to more lenient treatment.</p>
<p>Camdessus has confirmed reports that Chinese authorities pressured the IMF to include Hong, who had been working at the international organisation's headquarters in Washington, on a mission to China.</p>
<p>The Chinese actions created a furore at the IMF and Camdessus said in a letter to the organisation's staff he would closely monitor a second trial.</p>
<p>&quot;I also urged that the second open trial be transparent and complete and remedy the shortcomings of the first trial,&quot; Camdessus said after he visited Beijing last month.</p>
<p>Xinhua did not mention the original trial but it highlighted the legality and openness of the second.</p>
<p>It said the case was put on open trial on August 9 and that Hong, his two defence lawyers and four witnesses appeared in court and were involved in the proceedings.</p>
<p>It also said that 200 people, including Hong's relatives and IMF officials, were present.</p>
<p>It added that the man accused of offering the bribe, Fan Honggen, and other individuals from the Agricultural Bank would be dealt with in a separate case. It did not give further details.</p>
