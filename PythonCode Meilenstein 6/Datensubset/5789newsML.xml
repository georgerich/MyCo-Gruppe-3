<title>UK: NWE fuel oil - cracked firms as some see tightness.</title>
<headline>NWE fuel oil - cracked firms as some see tightness.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-08-21</dateline>

<p>Fuel oil was firmer on the back of increased demand and a perception of some tightness.</p>
<p>High sulphur barges gained up to $2 trading as high as $100 fob ARA form Tuesday's $98, but drifted towards $98-99 later in the day. One trader was a particuarly active buyer and most dealers felt the push upwards lacked fundemental support.</p>
<p>High sulphur cargoes were also firmer. A major sold to a trader half on a fixed basis and half floating with the fixed level at $78.75 fob NWE.</p>
<p>The cargo was high density and the market was probably closer to a deal done at $96 cif NWE on a small parcel.</p>
<p>Low sulphur cracked cargoes kept pace and traded higher.</p>
<p>A 20kt good quality packet was done at $106 fob NWE for an end Aug loading. A Scandanvian cargo on 10-15 September looked for a similar price, but was offered on a floating basis.</p>
<p>Wednesday's deals consoliated two trades done yesterday into Scandanavia at $110.25 and $110.75 cif NWE, which in turn had built upon Monday's $102 fob NWE.</p>
<p>Some traders felt the physical market, which has been lagging paper in recent weeks, was still not quite on parity.</p>
