<p>Russia raked in more tax revenues in the first 15 days of August than in the first half of each of the previous three months and met targets set by the International Monetary Fund, a Finance Ministry official said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>But Jochen Wermuth, head of the Finance Ministry's economic expert group, said that revenues -- 5.2 trillion roubles for the 15-day period -- were well below the government's 25 trillion rouble target for the month.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a significant upward trend in revenue collection and that is why the IMF is happy,&quot; he said. &quot;It is still below target, but this is what the IMF wanted for this month.&quot;</p>
<p>Wermuth said revenues averaged 520 billion roubles for each working day in the first 15 days of August, compared with an average of 411 billion for the working days in the first half of May, June and July.</p>
<p>The IMF said on Monday that a mission looking at Russia's revenue performance was returning to Washington satisfied that Russia was taking the measures needed to boost revenue collection.</p>
<p>The IMF had delayed the release of the July tranche of a $10 billion three-year loan because it was worried about Russia's ability to meet revenue targets.</p>
<p>Some Russian officials have said they hope for a double payment this month, combining the July and August tranches of the loan.</p>
<p>But Moscow office head Thomas Wolf said on Monday a second delegation had arrived in Moscow to look at August data and assess whether Russia was doing enough to receive that installment of the loan.</p>
<p>Release of the loan would be viewed as a clear vote of confidence in Russian economic policy by domestic and and foreign investors.</p>
<p>But any news may be overshadowed by investor concern about Russian political instability and the virtual disappearance of President Boris Yeltsin, who has not been seen in public since he was inaugurated for a second term on August 9.</p>
<p>Aides, denying persistent rumours that Yeltsin has been taken ill, say the Kremlin leader has started a two-day break in the picturesque lakeland of northwestern Russia.</p>
