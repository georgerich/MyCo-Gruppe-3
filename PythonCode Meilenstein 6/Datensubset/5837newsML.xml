<p>WCE canola futures settled higher on Wednesday bolstered by good crusher buying at the close, traders said.</p>
<p>August was exiting the board on Wednesday which accounted for its declines, one trader said.</p>
<p>He noted that flaxseed did not trade. It was bid up by locals and commercials and there was no selling, he said.</p>
<p>August canola was off $0.50 to $459.50 a tonne while September canola gained $1.20 at $424.70.</p>
<p>October flaxseed climbed $3.30 to $392.50.</p>
<p>Another trader said the feature in the feed wheat was the October/December spread. &quot;Firmness in the nearby cash position supported October feed wheat,&quot; he said. The October/December spread closed at $12.50 a tonne over the December, up from Tuesday's close of $11.10, he said.</p>
<p>Western barley had continued liquidation in the August position which expired on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The trader said commercial buying buoyed November barley with commercials as both buyers and sellers in the August position.</p>
<p>August western barley lost $3.40 at $159.00 while nearby November rose $1.60 to $158.90. October feed wheat climbed $3.40 at $202.00 and December gained $2.00 to $189.50.</p>
<p>Very little activity was noted in feed peas, he said.</p>
<p>(All values in Canadian dollars/tonne except peas, oats, which are in U.S. dollars.)</p>
