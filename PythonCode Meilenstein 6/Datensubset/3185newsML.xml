<p>NATO blew up 24 tonnes of contraband Bosnian Serb ammunition on Tuesday in a fourth day of Operation Volcano that sent a towering column of dirt and smoke 4,000 feet (1,220 metres) into the air.</p>
<p>About 2,000 NATO-led peace implementation troops were despatched to the area from Saturday to ensure the blasts in special pits proceeded safely.</p>
<p>Even as the operation went ahead, NATO officers sought to allay Bosnian Serb concern about any environmental effect of the explosions on the local water table and fielded complaints about broken windows.</p>
<p>&quot;Serb worries about the local water table have halted work in one set of pits for the moment but the operation continues in a second set of pits,&quot; NATO's Lieutenant-Colonel Max Marriner told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;Operation Volcano is proceeding even as we respond to local environmental concerns. Theoretically we could destroy all the material in the second set of pits or find a third site. The material will be destroyed one way or the other.&quot;</p>
<p>A routine NATO patrol discovered an estimated 400 tonnes of small arms ammunition, anti-tank and anti-personnel mines in a schoolhouse in Margetici, near Sokolac, on August 5.</p>
<p>Because the Margetici site had not been declared to NATO as required under the terms of the Dayton peace agreement, troops confiscated the material and prepared to destroy it in an operation codenamed &quot;Volcano&quot;.</p>
<p>NATO engineers dug two sets of blast-pits in a remote area near Margetici to contain the exploding munitions in lots of a few tonnes each.</p>
<p>Altogether 24 tonnes of munitions were destroyed on Monday and another 24 tonnes on Tuesday.</p>
<p>On Monday the Serbs complained that blasts from one set of pits might contaminate water resources in the area.</p>
<p>Blasting continued in the other set while NATO engineers considered the Serb complaint.</p>
<p>The Mayor of Sokolac saw NATO officers in Margetici on Tuesday to renew complaints about the water table, and about broken windows in his town.</p>
<p>He said the damage included windows in the Orthodox church, although windows much closer to the blast site were not damaged on Monday or Tuesday.</p>
<p>But the commander of NATO land forces in Bosnia, Lieutenant-General Sir Michael Walker, was willing to hear more about the water table impact. &quot;We are taking the issue seriously indeed,&quot; Walker told reporters in Margetici.</p>
<p>&quot;We've done quite alot of what I might call superficial geological examination and it seems to us the claim that it could do damage to the water table is probably not correct.&quot;</p>
<p>Walker said if there were any chance of environmental damage NATO would not use the suspect set of pits.</p>
<p>Operation Volcano is expected to continue for the rest of the week.</p>
