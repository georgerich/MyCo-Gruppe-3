<p>Albanian fishermen have killed a rare sea lion and are demanding $3,000 for its corpse, which is being stored in a refrigerator, a leading Albanian biologist said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Ferdinand Bego said there was no doubt the sea lion was a member of an endangered species, but added: &quot;We don't know exactly which species because these animals are so foreign to our region.&quot;</p>
<p>The fishermen caught the animal in their nets off the coast of north-western Albania, and initially played with it.</p>
<p>&quot;But we began clubbing it when it tried to leave,&quot; one of the men said on national television.</p>
<p>&quot;Then one of our friends who was drunk fired on it when it tried to escape. He killed it after two hours.&quot;</p>
<p>Officials of Albania's Environmental Protection Committee have urged police to seize the rare catch so it can be embalmed or its skeleton exhibited in a museum, Albania's ATA news agency said.</p>
