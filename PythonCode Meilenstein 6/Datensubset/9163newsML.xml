<headline>Yeltsin says will spend vacation inside Russia - RIA.</headline>
<dateline>MOSCOW 1996-08-22</dateline>

<p>Russian President Boris Yeltsin, whose eight-week absence in public caused rumours about his health, said on Thursday that if he took his vacation he would stay in Russia rather than go abroad.</p>
<p>&quot;Rumours circulate about my (possible) trip to Switzerland,&quot; Yeltsin said in a televised interview with RIA news agency.</p>
<p>&quot;Thanks to the press for the invitation but I cannot go as there are problems which should be solved here,&quot; Yeltsin said. &quot;If I take my leave, I will spend it on Russian territory.&quot;</p>
<p>Yeltsin, 65, who had two heart attacks last year, disappeared from public view in late June at the end of a vigorous re-election campaign. He appeared only briefly at an inauguration ceremony on August 9.</p>
<p>Yeltsin's aides have denied media reports that the Kremlin chief was ill and needed heart surgery, possibly in Switzerland. They have insisted Yeltsin was fine though in need of a rest after the election campaign.</p>
<p>The president, who faces an upsurge of fighting in rebel Chechnya where separatists have seized the capital Grozny, just spent two days in the picturesque lakeland of Valdai in northwestern Russia, where he was seeking a vacation refuge.</p>
<p>He returned to Moscow on Wednesday and there has been no word since then whether he planned to return to Valdai for a longer break.</p>
