<headline>Baltic Freight Index up two, Ldn freight subdued.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-08-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>The London dry cargo freight market went into a long, three-day holiday weekend still edging higher but in subdued activity with brokers awaiting a brisker level of inquiry expected next week to confirm any uptrend.</p>
<p>The Baltic Freight Index (BFI) rose just two points to 1,119.</p>
<p>Brokers remained wary of calling a turnaround in the market basis the recent performance of the BFI, although it has been going up since August 8, 1996.</p>
<p>They said it had risen in that interval only by a modest 59 points from a four-year August 8 low at 1,060.</p>
<p>Most impetus has come from the Capesize sector with Panamaxes lagging. Panamaxes now also seem, as one London broker put it, to be &quot;nudging up&quot;.</p>
<p>On Friday Gina Iuliano was reported fixed 54,000 tonnes of heavy grains U.S. Gulf/Japan for October 1/10 at $21.25 with no combination.</p>
<p>That follows Thursday's word that MSK fixed 54,000/5 tonnes heavy grain U.S. Gulf/Japan with Ocean Ruby for September 10-17 at $20.90 no combo, in turn 40 cents up on a Navios deal at the end of last week for comparable dates.</p>
<p>London brokers expect when they return on Tuesday there may be a modest flurry of new orders for end-September.</p>
<p>That activity may prove a better measure of how far owners caan justify optimism that the uptick will be more than a small, short-term development can be justified.</p>
<p>Biffex futures were unnerved early by word that Marubneni fixed 52,000/54,000 heavy grains U.S. Gulf for January/March 1997 at $22.00 basis no combination.</p>
<p>This was 50 cents below the last done for first quarter 1997 and fuelled downside sentiment, although this was later offset by broader expectations of a pickup in demand after October.</p>
<p>Most-traded Biffex October was off six at 1,265 late in London's afternoon.</p>
<p>Longer-term, German trader Alfred Toepfer on Friday predicted global wheat trade would fall in 1996/97 amid declining import orders from China.</p>
<p>It put global imports at 90.5 million tonnes compared with 92.6 million in the 1995/96 season.</p>
<p>A U.S. Department of Agriculture report 10 days ago also estimated that China was likely to reduce wheat imports by one million tonnes to eight million.</p>
<p>Besides slightly firmer U.S. Gulf grain fixtures this week, the gain on the BFI has reflected stronger rates Hampton Roads/ Rotterdam for coal.</p>
