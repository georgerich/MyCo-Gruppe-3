<p>The chief of Argentina's CGT main union federation said Friday he met with government officials but denied he was negotiating to avert a planned general strike.</p>
<p>&quot;We weren't negotiating any strike with them,&quot; CGT boss Gerardo Martinez told the state-owned Telam news agency. &quot;Our stance is still for changes to the framework of an economic policy that generates unemployment and recession.&quot;</p>
<p>Martinez said Thursday's meeting was requested by the government, which was represented by top congressmen including the powerful former Cabinet Chief Eduardo Bauza.  </p>
<p>Union heads are due to hold a procedural meeting Friday but said they decided to put off a planned strike vote for eight or nine days.</p>
<p>It was the second time the unions have postponed the strike vote, which they first put off last Tuesday after a disagreement between supporters of the CGT and the hard-line MTA splinter group. Seven workers were hurt in the shootout.</p>
<p>The CGT and the MTA, which represents transport unions, have since edged back into talks together. The two groups both participated in the successful 24-hour general strike August 8 and are planning to stage a new one in September.  </p>
<p>The daily Clarin Friday quoted union sources saying that Martinez and other top CGT officials with close links to the Peronist Party government were about to lose their jobs to more militant officials, including MTA representatives.</p>
<p>One of the disagreements between the CGT and the MTA was over the length of the new strike. The CGT favored a 36-hour stoppage while the MTA wanted 48 hours.</p>
<p>CGT officials said after the shootout they now wanted a shorter 24-hour strike, without any union marches, because they wanted to avoid any risk of further violence.</p>
