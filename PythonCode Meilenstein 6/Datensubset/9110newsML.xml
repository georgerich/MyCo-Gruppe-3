<title>RUSSIA: Communist joins Russian government team.</title>

<p>President Boris Yeltsin, back in the Kremlin after a two-day vacation, gave a ministerial job on Thursday to a communist who ran against him for president.</p>
<p>Russian news agencies said Yeltsin had appointed Aman Tuleyev as minister responsible for relations with other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States, the loose grouping created when the Soviet Union fell apart in 1991.</p>
<p>His party sought the restoration of the Soviet Union in recent Russian election campaigns, but said this should be done through negotiation rather than by force.</p>
<p>Tuleyev, a bear-like Siberian with a shock of black hair, was effectively the understudy to communist party leader Gennady Zyuganov in the presidential campaign.</p>
<p>But he dropped out of the race just before the first round of the election to allow the so-called national-patriotic coalition to field a single candidate.</p>
<p>Zyuganov won through to the second round, where he lost decisively to Yeltsin in a campaign where the president's team dwelt heavily on the horrors of Russia's communist past and urged voters not to turn back the clock.</p>
<p>Yeltsin also named his first woman cabinet minister, giving the health portfolio to Tatyana Dmitrieva.</p>
<p>She appeared with Yeltsin in a fleeting television clip, the first time he has been shown on television since his inauguration, and she told Interfax news agency that they had discussed fundamental questions about health care.</p>
<p>Another new appointee is Pyotr Rodionov -- not to be confused with Defence Minister Igor Rodionov -- who was named fuel and energy minister.</p>
<p>He currently works for the St Petersburg branch of gas monopoly Gazprom, the company for which Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin worked before joining the government.</p>
<p>Yuri Bespalov is to become industry minister, Anatoly Zaitsev is the new minister for railway communications and Viktor Orlov minister for natural resources.</p>
<p>Most of the new Russian government team was appointed earlier this month, after Yeltsin was inaugurated for a second term as president.</p>
