<p>South Africa was on course to attracting the kind of investment needed to reach the target of six percent growth, Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin said.</p>
<p>&quot;The fundamentals in the economy with regard to investment potential, trade potential are...looking sound and we are quite happy with the levels of investment that are occurring,&quot; he told a media briefing at parliament.</p>
<p>Key projects included the recently launched Maputo corridor, linking the industrial heartland around Johannesburg with the Mozambican port.</p>
<p>The same corridor concept was being extended to the Wild Coast in the Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, the area around Saldanha Bay in the Western Cape, and in the Free State.</p>
<p>&quot;The number of investment projects that are emerging...is truly quite exciting and over the next few months these will be unfolding on a regular basis,&quot; Erwin said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that what we can foresee is that the level of investment that is needed to get us to the six percent growth rate is definitely within our grasp.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not talking about nothing here. We are talking about some very exciting investment initiatives.&quot;</p>
<p>One drawback remained the fact that many existing industries were uncompetitive by world standards, but this was being addressed by a series of cluster studies on key sectors.</p>
<p>These were aimed at identifying strengths and weaknesses and ways in which productivity and competitiveness could be improved.</p>
<p>Erwin added that negotiations with the European Union on a proposed free trade agreement were due to resume in September but it was clear that the current offer by the EU posed many difficulties for South Africa.</p>
<p>&quot;The proposal by the EU is inherently a complicated proposal...so we have to consider our response very carefully,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;As it stands right at the moment...it would look as if we are in for a fairly protracted negotiation.&quot;</p>
