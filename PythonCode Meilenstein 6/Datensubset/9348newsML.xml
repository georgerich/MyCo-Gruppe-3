<p>The leader of Hong Kong's main democratic grouping said on Thursday he had scrapped a Taiwan visit but denied it was because he feared upsetting China or ruining a chance for smoother relations with Beijing.</p>
<p>Democratic Party leader Martin Lee confirmed press reports that the party had planned a high-level visit to Taiwan this summer but it was now off.</p>
<p>The development came amid a row between China and Ukraine over a visit to Kiev by Taiwan Vice-President Lien Chan.</p>
<p>Lee told Hong Kong radio his trip had been called off because of a busy travel agenda, including visits to Europe, New Zealand, Australia, Japan, and a fund-raising trip to Canada.</p>
<p>&quot;Because of all these various commitments we decided to postpone it indefinitely,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Asked if a possibility of a thaw in his frosty relations with China had been a factor, Lee said the postponement of the trip to Taiwan &quot;clearly predated China's olive branch&quot;.</p>
<p>This was a reference to an offer by China to improve relations with Hong Kong's democratic movement.</p>
<p>Vice-Premier Qian Qichen said in Beijing this month that people with divergent views on democracy could be brought on board the China-controlled panel that will pick Hong Kong's political leadership after Britain withdraws next year.</p>
<p>Qian's remark was widely interpreted as an olive branch to the Democratic Party, which upsets China with its support for mainland dissidents and its accusations that Beijing plans to snuff out democracy in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Hong Kong reverts to China next July 1 after a century and a half of British colonial rule.</p>
<p>The handover is the first step in reintegrating formerly Chinese-ruled territories that the communist People's Republic of China failed to incorporate when it was founded in 1949.</p>
<p>Until now China has kept the Democrats out of preparatory work on the sovereignty transfer.</p>
<p>For their part, the Democrats have opposed China's plan to dissolve the territory's elected legislature and put an appointed one in its place next July.</p>
<p>Taiwan became the refuge of the Nationalists when the communists defeated them in China's civil war in 1949.</p>
<p>Beijing views the island as a rebel province and interprets official contacts with Taipei by third parties as actions aimed at creating &quot;two Chinas&quot;.</p>
