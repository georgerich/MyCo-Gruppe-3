<p>Shares in UK mobile telephone operator Orange Plc rose on Tuesday after the company reported interim losses broadly in line with expectations.</p>
<p>The company edged two pence higher to 189p by 0714 GMT in pre-market trade, after it posted a first half pre-tax loss of 125.2 million stg.</p>
<p>Analysts forecasts had ranged from 100 million stg to 132 million with a consensus at 124 million. They said on Tuesday that the tone of the statement was confident.  </p>
<p>&quot;It's a good set of figures... some of the fears we've had in the past weren't justified,&quot; said ABN Amro Hoare Govett telecommunications analyst James Ross. He identified in particular a fall in the &quot;churn&quot; rate -- how many customers cease using Orange. This decreased to 17.6 percent in the year to June 30 from 18.1 percent in the year to end December.</p>
<p>&quot;They've obviously got a control on that,&quot; said Mike Styles of Credit Lyonnais Laing.</p>
<p>There was positive news from monthly revenue per subscriber figures, which rose to 36.86 stg from 36.51 stg year on year.  </p>
<p>Orange managing director Hans Snook said that the company's network covered over 90 percent of the country's population.</p>
<p>&quot;We continue to meet our business plan expectations with strong growth year on year in Orange subscribers and revenues,&quot; said Snook in a statement accompanying the results.</p>
<p>Sales in the first half more than doubled to 256.5 million stg from 100 million stg.</p>
