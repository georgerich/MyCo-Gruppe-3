<headline>Ringgit gains limited by KL corporate dlr buying.</headline>
<dateline>KUALA LUMPUR 1996-08-23</dateline>

<p>Dollar buying by Kuala Lumpur-based corporates limited the ringgit's gains in afternoon trading, dealers said on Friday.</p>
<p>They said the ringgit was off the day's high and was expected to trade in a range in the near future.</p>
<p>&quot;Heavy (dollar) selling from Japan started in the morning. Some U.S. funds also joined in,&quot; a dealer with a Singapore-based European bank said.</p>
<p>&quot;But, there was (dollar) demand from KL commercials at 2.4925, which limited the dollar/ringgit downside,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Dealers said Japanese funds were mainly investing in Singapore and Malaysia as hopes of an interest rate hike in Japan were fading.</p>
<p>One Singapore-based dealer said ringgit was expected to trade in the 2.4910/60 range in the near-term.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is watching for trade, growth numbers this month and a possible savings bond issue,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>At 0900 GMT, the ringgit was at 2.4930/35 per dollar against 2.4948/58 at close of Kuala Lumpur on Thursday. The Singapore dollar was at 0.5654/60 per ringgit against 0.5649/55.</p>
