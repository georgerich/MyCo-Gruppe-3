<p>Russia intends to shift support of the agricultural industry from the federal to the regional level, but a top agricultural official said on Tuesday that 1997 federal farm supports could be higher than ever.</p>
<p>&quot;The Agriculture Ministry has officially asked for about 36 trillion roubles for support of the agricultural sector next year (1997),&quot; Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Zaveryukha told a news conference.</p>
<p>But he said the finance ministry was offering 26 trillion in ministerial negotiations.</p>
<p>The 1996 budget earmarked 13.17 trillion roubles for the farm sector in subsidies and grants in February of this year.</p>
<p>Zaveryukha, in charge of Russia's harvest, said federal cash grants alone, of 7.2 trillion roubles, were half regional grants of 14 trillion in 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;We have shifted support of agriculture to the regions,&quot; he said. But he said federal grants and credits together were close to regional levels.</p>
<p>But he added that 36 trillion roubles was the bare minimum for 1997 federal support.</p>
<p>&quot;It is the minimal amount that will allow support of the leasing, fertiliser and credit funds,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Annual inflation in Russia this year is expected to be between 25 and 35 percent.</p>
<p>Zaveryukha also said the federal government was rushing 100 billion roubles worth of spare parts and combine harvesters to Siberia, the last major region to harvest its wheat and a key to Russian grain independence.</p>
<p>The government forecasts the grain harvest this year will be 77 million tonne harvest, well up on last year's drought-hit 63.4 million tonnes. Some independent estimates say a harvest of 72 million tonnes is more likely.</p>
<p>Zaveryukha said Russia would be able to meet its grain needs and would both import and export about 4-5 million tonnes.</p>
