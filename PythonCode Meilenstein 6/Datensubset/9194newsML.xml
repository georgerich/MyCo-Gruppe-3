<p>Yugoslavia has quietly dropped previous demands and accepted conditions set out by the International Monetary Fund for restoring its membership in the IMF, a prominent economist said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The government adopted a decree last Thursday on the country's membership with the IMF based on the December 14, 1992 decision of the IMF Board of Directors and will present it to the federal parliament at its August 29 session.</p>
<p>Independent analysts said the official wording accompanying the decree -- which has not been made public yet -- indicated that it accepted IMF conditions that the cabinet previously rejected.</p>
<p>&quot;The decree accepts identical conditions presented by the IMF in March. We have lost precious six months and now face a real problem of how to restructure our debts,&quot; Miroljub Labus, a chief economist of the Economic Institute, told reporters.</p>
<p>He indicated, however, that the government's hopes pinned on the decree may be too far-fetched.</p>
<p>&quot;The government's idea is to get the first so-called golden tranche from the IMF to the extent of $120 million -- the amount rump Yugoslavia owes the Fund -- (which) is unrealistic,&quot; Labus said.</p>
<p>&quot;First we must reactivate our IMF membership, repay what we owe and then prepare an economic programme and submit it to the Fund,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The IMF would condition any further help on the real value of the dinar, the central bank discount rate as well as lower public spending, he added.</p>
<p>The decree, so far not made public even in the Official Gazzette, does not contain a word on the legal continuity of rump Yugoslavia, according to a senior government official, who asked not to be named.</p>
<p>The continuity issue -- Belgrade wants to be seen as the legal successor to old Yugoslavia -- was at the heart of a dispute with the IMF.</p>
<p>Although the Yugoslav government has not released the decree, it issued a statement saying the decree &quot;means Yugoslavia has ratified the IMF document and that its membership with the Fund is recognised without any interruption since 1945.&quot;</p>
<p>The government official told Reuters that the decree was a step forward but further negotiations were still needed.</p>
<p>&quot;Even though the legal document marks progress, it is still too early to say Yugoslavia's IMF membership will be resolved immediately after the Fund is notified of Yugoslavia's decision.</p>
<p>Some economists predicted Yugoslavia would normalise its relations with the IMF and other creditors after September elections in Bosnia when U.N. sanctions, suspended last November, are expected to be permanently lifted.</p>
