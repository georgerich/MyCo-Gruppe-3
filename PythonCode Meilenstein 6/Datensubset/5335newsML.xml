<dateline>NEW DELHI, India</dateline>

<p>India and the United States signed an agreement Wednesday to work jointly on various projects in the energy sector which could translate into huge American investments in India, officials said.</p>
<p>The agreement, signed after two days of talks between officials of both countries, includes plans to jointly develop policies for private investments in power projects in India's mainly state-controlled energy sector.</p>
<p>&quot;We focused on certain suggestions made by our private sector,&quot; Dirk Forrister, assistant secretary in the U.S. Department of Energy, leader of the American delegation, told Reuters after a news conference.</p>
<p>The agreement was signed barely a month after India finally cleared a $2.1 billion power project planned by Enron Corp. after a year-long dispute.</p>
<p>Forrister said India has promised the United States faster clearances of power projects to facilitate investments in India's energy sector.</p>
<p>&quot;We will speed up clearances and lay down relevant policies,&quot; India's power secretary P. Abraham told reporters.</p>
<p>Energy officials say India's current installed capacity is 87,000 megawatts per year and it will rise to 142,000 mega watts by 2007.</p>
<p>Abraham said both countries would jointly lay down policies for greater private participation in hydroelectric projects and chalk out procedures to finance small and medium-sized power projects.</p>
<p>A joint advisory group on coal will be formed to accelerate utilization of coal fly ash, Abraham said.</p>
<p>Officials of both countries will also jointly work on projects related to renewable energy, energy efficiency and reduction of green house gas emissions.</p>
<p>Forrister said the agreement would make it easier for international investors to set up power units in India.</p>
