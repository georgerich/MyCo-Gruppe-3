<p>High sulphur fuel oil prices were expected to rise on crude gains, traders said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Prices of 180-cst supplies were bid/asked at $103/$105 on Tuesday.</p>
<p>A Singapore-based trader said &quot;a good price to sell would be $105&quot; for 180-cst supplies loading in September.</p>
<p>The same trader told Reuters the company has supplies to offer in September if the bids are &quot;high enough&quot;.</p>
<p>The same Mideast trader seen bidding on Wednesday is expected to place his bids later Thursday.</p>
<p>In the swaps market, the September, October and November papers were bid/asked at $101.50/$103.50, slighty higher from Wednesday's quotes at $101/$102 for September.</p>
<p>Traders said regional demand from Thailand and Indonesia remained uncovered. They said reduced supplies caused by refinery cuts and reduced Mideast supplies in August have helped to support prices. But Chinese demand remained lacklustre.</p>
<p>Trader expected Mideast supplies to be higher in September.</p>
