<p>Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer met his Chinese counterpart in Beijing on Thursday at the start of a four-day visit to China that follows growing friction between the two nations.</p>
<p>Downer met Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and witnessed the signing of an agreement on Australia's consulate in Hong Kong, the Xinhua news agency said.</p>
<p>The agreement formally permits Australia to maintain its consulate in Hong Kong after the British colony returns to Chinese rule on July 1, 1997.</p>
<p>Australia was one of the first countries to reach such an accord with Beijing, the news agency said.</p>
<p>It gave no details of Downer's meeting with Qian.</p>
<p>Relations between China and Australia have been strained in recent weeks, partly because of Australia's plan to sell uranium to China's rival Taiwan.</p>
<p>Other issues affecting ties include plans by an Australian cabinet minister to visit Taiwan and a scheduled visit to Australia next month by Tibet's exiled spiritual leader the Dalai Lama.</p>
<p>China routinely objects to foreign officials meeting the 1989 Nobel Peace prize winner, insisting he is spearheading a campaign for Tibetan independence.</p>
<p>Last month Downer said he would raise the case of jailed Chinese-born Australian businessman James Peng during his meetings with Beijing officials.</p>
<p>Peng, 36, was sentenced to 18 years in a Chinese prison last September after being convicted of embezzling about A$240,000 (US$180,000) in the southern boomtown of Shenzhen. He has insisted he was framed by powerful commercial rivals.</p>
