<p>NYMEX crude oil prices ended the week lower on profit taking which accelerated after three crude ports in Mexico were re-opened after being shut down due to a hurricane, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;We had a bounce yesterday, and traders just lightened their positions ahead of the weekend. The Mexican news that was helping to support was taken out,&quot; said Tom Bentz, a trader with ING Derivatives.</p>
<p>October crude settled 34 cents lower to $21.96 a barrel. The near-term support level for October crude was pegged by Bentz at $21.85 to $21.90.  </p>
<p>Mexico's state-owned oil company Petroleos Mexicanos re-opened all three of its crude ports after shutting them down for two days due to Hurricane Dolly.</p>
<p>Market sources estimated the ports export 1.5 million barrels daily.</p>
<p>Traders said Friday's expiry of September refined product options drove prices of the underlying months down around the strike prices.</p>
<p>September heating oil closed 0.49 cent lower at 61.99 cents a gallon, and September unleaded gasoline closed off 0.66 cent to 63.22 cents a gallon.  </p>
<p>Traders said they expect heating oil prices to rebound on Monday due to inventories currently being at historical lows.</p>
<p>Traders said the tight stocks have created an unusual backwardation in August for heating oil, where the front months are more expensive than the back months.</p>
<p>Usually in August, heating oil contracts are in contango, with the later months carrying a higher price reflecting increasing demand as the winter nears.</p>
<p>September heating oil closed Friday 0.66 cent a gallon above the January contract.</p>
