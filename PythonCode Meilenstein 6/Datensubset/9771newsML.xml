<p>Danish share prices closed higher on Thursday, reviving as the stream of 1996 interim corporate results continued to pour in, with major activity reported and more gains foreseen ahead of the weekend.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a hectic day on the stock market. We should see more advances tomorrow with the focus on the three leading banks, all of whose interim results we now have,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>The KFX top-20 index finished 0.29 point up at 120.15 in overall bourse turnover of 1.090 billion crowns. The KFX Septembe future rose 0.10 point to 120.35 with 200 contracts each worth 100,000 crowns traded.  </p>
<p>The day was dominated by Den Danske Bank, the country's biggest, which delivered a first-half result lower than a year ago along with cautious forecasts for the rest of 1996.</p>
<p>Den Danske Bank closed six crowns up at 402 in volume of over 300,000 shares. Rival Unibank, which produced a better than expected interim result earlier in the week, finished one down at 264, while third biggest BG Bank ended unchanged at 204.</p>
