<p>The following are analysts' reactions to Japan's indices of economic indicators for June, released on Tuesday, which showed a figure of 70.0 on a scale of 100 for the diffusion index of leading economic indicators, and 55.0 for the index of coincident indicators.</p>
<p>The figures were exactly in line with analysts' forecasts.</p>
<p>SATOSHI SHIMAMOTO, MMS INTERNATIONAL: &quot;Basically, this figure was calculated based on data from three months ago. The June figure was based on March data, which was quite weak. That's why both figures were above the critical 50 level.&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;Today's data confirm that the economic recovery is still moderate. I don't think there will be any change in the outlook for the Bank of Japan's monetary policy. We have to wait for an announcement of the (BOJ's) tankan survey. Then you can see a new view of the economy.&quot;</p>
<p>MICHAEL HARTNETT, AT MERRILL LYNCH, TOKYO: &quot;They (the data) sort of confirmed that over coming months you should see industrial production trend upward. That's encouraging rather than discouraging. By and large, I think most indicators will stay above the so-called boost &quot;boom or bust&quot; 50 mark.&quot;</p>
