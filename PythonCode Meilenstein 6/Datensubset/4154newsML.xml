<p>CIA Director John Deutch said in a letter published on Tuesday that he had no plans to step down as top U.S. spymaster, contrary to published speculation.</p>
<p>In a letter to the editor of the Washington Post, Deutch took the paper to task for a front-page report last week that quoted him as having told friends he planned to leave at year's end.</p>
<p>&quot;First, I am not leaving,&quot; Deutch, who took over as intelligence chief in May 1995, wrote. &quot;I have no plans to leave. I repeated the same message to the White House the day the article appeared.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I will confess that I am now on vacation, but I shall return,&quot; he said. He added that he wanted to do all he could to make sure that the U.S. spy bureaucray remains &quot;the best in the world.&quot;</p>
<p>The Post had quoted one person identified as a Deutch friend as saying Deutch, a former deputy defence secretary, hoped to succeed William Perry as defence secretary if President Bill Clinton were re-elected to a second term.</p>
<p>Deutch replaced James Woolsey, Clinton's first intelligence chief. Woolsey quit in December 1994 after running into problems with Congress over his handling of the Aldrich Ames spy case, the worst known security breach in CIA history.</p>
