<p>German chemicals group BASF AG should achieve 1996 net and pre-tax profits slightly higher than year-earlier earnings, group chief financial officer Max Dietrich Kley said on Thursday.</p>
<p>In a speech for delivery at a news conference in London, Kley said that this forecast might prove very conservative, given the chance for an upturn in the German economy.  </p>
<p>&quot;According to our current projection, we are assuming that both profit before taxes and net income after taxes for total 1996 will be slightly higher than in 1995,&quot; Kley said.</p>
<p>&quot;If there would be an economic upswing in the second half of the year, which is expected by some of our competitors, surely our prediction of today is very conservative,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>BASF earlier reported a rise in first-half pre-tax profit to 2.323 billion marks from 2.025 billion, boosted by favourable currency developments and better performances at its pharmaceuticals, oil and gas and crop protection businesses.  </p>
<p>The crop protection activities will contribute less to second half profits due to the seasonal pattern in this sector, executive chairman Juergen Strube told reporters here.</p>
<p>The first half profit rise was achieved despite lower results in the chemicals business where prices have fallen sharply, partly due to customers running down their stocks.</p>
<p>But Strube, who noted rising orders in most business areas in July, said he believed the de-stocking process had stopped as economies were picking up.</p>
<p>&quot;My overall impression is that de-stocking is coming to an end. Many customers will be enhancing their stock levels to accommodate for additional orders they are expecting,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The overall business climate in central Europe is improving,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
