<p>COFFEE: World market for August 19, 1996</p>
<p>Robusta futures in London closed lower but off session lows while traders awaited a new round of US certified stocks data. Traders expected another fall in US certified coffee stocks, and therefore there was general consensus that any drawdown would have no significant impact on prices. However, it was said a fresh drawdown could continue to underpin the September/December spread in New York. September lost $10 to close at $1,678, while November shed $14 to close at $1,657. In New York expectations of another drawdown in US certified coffee stocks and buying interest from the roasting sector underpinned prices, with buying seen at the 110 cent-mark basis December. After the close it was reported that certified coffee stocks fell by 6,259 60-kg bags in the week ended August 16, to 34,516 bags.</p>
<p>However, this was no surprise and the fact that 19,000 bags of coffee were pending grading, or approval, at exchange warehouses was taken as bearish and it was said that this could exert some pressure on the nearby switch. However, there is no guarantee that the whole lot will be certified and it apparently did not pass in July. But even if the coffee is certified and quickly snatched up, it would show that there is still a tightness of nearby supplies and need for additional coffee, which could force the September/December spread even wider during the delivery period. Even if all 19,000 pending bags are certified, this would still be more than offset by the combined 26,000 bag drawdown seen in the past three weeks, traders said. Either way, the current ten-year low on inventories of deliverable coffee will continue to underpin the market.</p>
<p>FUNDAMENTALS</p>
<p>INDIA - Inadequate monsoon rain in June/July is likely to hurt India's 1996/97 (October/September) coffee crop. According to trade sources production in 1996/97 could be around 3.0 million bags, down from 3.75 million bags in 1995/96. However, it was emphasized that an accurate forecast would not be possible before September.</p>
<p>UNITED STATES - Certified coffee stocks showed another decline during the week ended August 16. Stocks in New York fell by 759 bags (-570 bags) to 2,299 bags (3,058 bags), while stocks in New Orleans declined by 5,500 bags (-8,785 bags) to 25,351 bags (30,851 bags). Stocks in San Francisco and Miami remained unchanged at 2,000 and 4,866 bags respectively.</p>
<p>UNITED STATES - Roastings during the week ended August 10 totalled approximately 395,000 60-kg bags, up from 340,000 bags in the previous week and compared with 345,000 bags in the corresponding week one year ago, Coffee Publications, Inc., said. Cumulative roastings totalled 10.325 million bags, vs 10.095 million bags in the same year-ago period.</p>
<p>DENMARK - Denmark imported 74,098 bags of coffee in May 1996, 2.2 per cent less than was imported the same month the previous year. That brought total imports since the beginning of 1996 up to 419,300 bags, 36 per cent more than was imported the same period in 1995. Total imports in calendar year 1995 dropped by 14 per cent to 873,700 bags. Major suppliers of green coffee in January/May 1996 were Brazil (104,500 vs 120,600 bags) and Colombia (92,200 vs 69,500 bags). The country exported 41,600 bags of coffee in January/May 1996, 25 per cent more than was exported the same period in 1995. Total exports in calendar year 1995 dropped by 5.5 per cent to 91,200 bags.</p>
