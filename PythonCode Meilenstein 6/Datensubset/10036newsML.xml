<title>JAPAN: Tokyo naphtha dips on crude in slow market.</title>
<headline>Tokyo naphtha dips on crude in slow market.</headline>

<p>Naphtha prices continued to slide on Thursday due to overnight crude losses in a dull market almost devoid of firm buyers, traders said.</p>
<p>Near-month contracts were being shunned because they were seen as being expensive and also because the market's backwardation was slowly narrowing, one trader said.</p>
<p>Second-half October open-spec naphtha was assessed bid at $193 and offered at $194. First-half November was assessed bid and offered at $192.25/$193.50.</p>
<p>The intra-month spread was assessed at $1.5/$2.5 for first-half October and first-half November.  </p>
<p>It was assessed at $1/$1.75 for second-half October and second-half November.</p>
<p>Sentiment for jet/kerosene was firm, a fact which some traders partly attributed to reduced runs at three refineries in Singapore. It was notionally assessed discussed at around MOPS plus $2.</p>
<p>Traders were still uncertain of the Japanese refineries' plans for winter stocks, but some believed spot requirements would probably be about the same as the past few years.</p>
