<p>Garlic pills may not lower blood cholesterol and studies that show they do may be flawed, British researchers have reported.</p>
<p>A study by a team of doctors at Oxford University has found people with high blood cholesterol do not benefit significantly from taking garlic tablets.</p>
<p>The study involved 115 people with high blood cholesterol levels. They were given 900 milligrams a day of dried garlic powder or placebo tablets. &quot;There were no significant differences between the groups receiving garlic and placebo,&quot; they wrote in the Journal of the Royal College of Physicians.  </p>
<p>Those taking part were told to eat a low-fat diet for six weeks before they started taking the pills, and their blood cholesterol measured before and after the six-week period. The researchers said this would make their findings more accurate.</p>
<p>Several studies have found garlic pills can lower blood pressure and blood cholesterol.</p>
<p>But the Oxford team disputed these findings and said either previous trials may have been interpreted incorrectly, those taking part were not given special diets beforehand or the duration of the studies may have been too short.</p>
<p>The six-month trial was funded by the British Heart Foundation and Lichtwer Pharma GmbH, which makes Kwai brand garlic tablets.</p>
<p>The study did not address whether whole garlic could affect cholesterol.</p>
