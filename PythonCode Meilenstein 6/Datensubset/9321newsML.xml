<p>Ecuador's populist new government banned a U.S. firm from drilling for oil Wednesday, sent the army to guard its installations and said it would revise all foreign crude oil operations in the country.</p>
<p>President Abdala Bucaram, who was elected in July and calls himself the &quot;president of the poor,&quot; ordered a ban on Maxus Energy Corp., owned by Argentine oil giant YPF SA, until it agreed to joint ventures with the state oil firm.</p>
<p>&quot;By order of the President of the Republic and by my order Maxus will not extract another barrel of oil from Ecuadoran soil,&quot; said Energy and Mining Minister Alfredo Adoum.</p>
<p>&quot;Either Maxus signs a joint-venture contract or it just leaves the country. I have even issued orders for the armed forces to take possession of the oil fields Maxus is exploiting,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>However in Buenos Aires, Nells Leon, president of Maxus' owner YPF, said its oil installations in Ecuador were operating normally and had not been taken by the army.</p>
<p>But he said he expected talks with the government in Quito on the ban would &quot;not be short&quot;.</p>
<p>U.S. oil companies with interests in Ecuador privately expressed concern about the implications of developments in the South American nation in the past two days.</p>
<p>&quot;It makes us feel very uncomfortable,&quot; said an executive at a U.S. oil company with interests in Ecuador. &quot;It's very confused and there are just too many things going on there a week and a half after they've had a change of government.&quot;</p>
<p>The head of state oil company Petroecuador, Patricio Lopez, said the government would revise all contracts with foreign companies extracting crude from Ecuadoran soil &quot;so that each one becomes a benefit for the state.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Each company is a separate problem and we have to revise each one of them,&quot; said Lopez.</p>
<p>Foreign oil firms operating in Ecuador include France's Elf Aquitaine, Spain's Repsol, and Arco and Occidental Petroleum Corp. of the United States.</p>
<p>Maxus is the only one which does not have a production-sharing deal with the government under a regulation requiring that foreign firms grant the state at least 12.5 percent of output.</p>
<p>Lopez assured the ban on Maxus, which has been operating in the Amazon near the Colombian border for nine years, would not affect foreign oil investments: &quot;No way -- as long as companies hand over to the Ecuadoran state a stake, since it is owner of the land and soil and has to have some benefit.&quot;</p>
<p>Ecuador accused Maxus of giving &quot;1,000 excuses&quot; to delay signing a new contract and Adoum proclaimed, &quot;We are not going to let them rob us. Up to now, the Ecuadoran people has not had a taste of one single liter of oil extracted by Maxus.&quot;</p>
<p>The union representing Petroecuador workers supported the ban on Maxus, which it accused of &quot;yielding the state zero profitability.&quot; It called for more foreign oil firm bans.</p>
