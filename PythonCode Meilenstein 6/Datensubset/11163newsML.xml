<p>Argentina's Economy Minister Roque Fernandez said on Friday that there will be no problems in obtaining a waiver from the International Monetary Fund, according to local news agencies.</p>
<p>&quot;We think there will be no problems in getting a waiver,&quot; from the IMF Fernandez told news agencies on Friday evening after his first formal meeting with a delegation from the organization that arrived in Argentina at the beginning of the week to asses the Argentine economy.  </p>
<p>The minister added that the IMF supported the government's recently announced fiscal measures, which mainly include tax increases aimed at reversing the budget deficit.</p>
<p>Argentina overshot its IMF agreed budget deficit target in the first half of the year by more than $1.0 billion and Fernandez launched the recent measures to ensure the deficit does not keep growing in the second half of the year.</p>
<p>Fernandez has stated that without the measures the budget for the whole year would have been $6.6 billion.  </p>
<p>The IMF and Argentina initially agreed on a deficit target for the whole year of $2.5 billion. In April, the IMF approved a $1.05 billion, 21-month standby loan, but only about $168 was drawn down before it became clear that Argentina would not be able to meet the targets of the program.</p>
<p>When Fernandez announced the latest economic measures a couple of weeks ago to improve tax collection, reduce the deficit and increase employment, the IMF welcomed the moves saying they &quot;provide renewed and welcome proof&quot; of the determination of the authorities to tighten the country's belt.  </p>
<p>Still, the government is struggling with delays in the passage of the measures through Congress, which may result in lower revenues to plug the deficit because the increased taxes on diesel fuel will only take effect later in the year.</p>
<p>In addition, local media have stated that Fernandez has already withdrawn the proposal to extend the retirement age of women to 65 years from 60 years, which originally was part of the plan.</p>
<p>Local media have stated that the IMF is particularly interested in assesing the amount of political support for the government's economic policies.</p>
