<headline>INTERVIEW - Ofgas says TransCo review final.</headline>

<p>Industry regulator Ofags said on Wednesday it would make no further concessions in any more talks with British Gas on the price proposals announced earlier today for pipleine operator TransCo.</p>
<p>&quot;I wouldn't go any further without taking it to the MMC (Monopolies and Mergers Commission),&quot; Ofgas director general Clare Spottiswoode told Reuters.  </p>
<p>&quot;Obviously there are a lot of small things, so we will have further discussions, but I want them to agree or disagree with the basics,&quot; Spottiswoode said.</p>
<p>Ofgas said earlier it wanted TransCo to slice 20 percent off its charges to gas suppliers in the year from April 1997, which was at the bottom of the price cut initially proposed in May.</p>
<p>Ofgas main concession was in the price cuts for the following years, saying prices should drop by an annual 2.5 percent rather than five as proposed earlier. &quot;That is the result of going outside the asset base range and giving them some more money on operating expenditure,&quot; Spottiswoode said.  </p>
<p>Extra information provided by British Gas had prompted Ofgas to add 27 million stg a year on average to its projections of Ofgas' costs.</p>
<p>Ofgas also raised its regulatory asset figure to 11.7 billion stg from an initial range of nine to 11 billion stg.</p>
<p>&quot;We wanted to make sure that we could...under any interpretation... not be accused of clawing back revenue that has already been allowed,&quot; Spottiswoode said.</p>
<p>British Gas has until October 7 to decide wether to accept or reject the final proposals. They will be referred to the MMC if rejected.</p>
