<headline>Dole's post-convention &quot;bounce&quot; may not be enough.</headline>

<p>By Alan Elsner, U.S. Political Correspondent</p>
<p>Bob Dole's presidential campaign received a substantial boost from last weeks's Republican convention. But was it enough?</p>
<p>President Bill Clinton still holds a lead of four to 12 percentage points over the Republican presidential nominee with 12 weeks to go until Election Day on Nov. 5, according to opinion polls released on Monday and Tuesday.</p>
<p>The polls were taken at a point when Dole was enjoying maximum benefit from a week in which he and his party were able to project their message to a national audience virtually uncontested by Democrats.</p>
<p>That period has already ended, and Clinton, a tireless campaigner and persuasive speaker, is moving to recapture the intitiative ahead of next week's Democratic convention.</p>
<p>Most worrying for Dole, evidence is growing that whatever bounce he received from the convention is already dissipating.</p>
<p>An ABC tracking poll that had Clinton only four points ahead of Dole on Monday showed his lead lengthening to 12 points by Tuesday in a three-way race that also included Texan billionaire Ross Perot.</p>
<p>Monday's poll had Clinton leading Dole by 44 percent to 40 percent. One day later, Clinton jumped to 49 percent and Dole slumped to 37 percent. Perot fell to 10 percent from 11 percent.</p>
<p>The figures were consistent with a New York Times/CBS poll released on Monday, which also showed Clinton leading by 12 points, 49 percent to 37 percent. Perot trailed with seven percent.</p>
<p>The phenomenon of the &quot;convention bounce&quot; is well documented in U.S. politics, and bounces seem to be growing larger as the electorate grows more volatile and less attached to the two major parties.</p>
<p>&quot;It just about always happens. It's real. What's important is how big it is and how long it lasts,&quot; Gary Langer, senior polling analyst for ABC television, said.</p>
<p>&quot;Dole remains well behind, given the fact that we haven't had the Democratic convention and Clinton's bump in the polls which will inevitably occur,&quot; said Mark Rozell, a political scientist at the American University in Washington.</p>
<p>With Clinton due to sign three popular pieces of legislation this week on health insurance, the minimum wage and welfare reform, the bloom may be off the Dole revival before the Democratic convention opens in Chicago next Monday.</p>
<p>University of Cinncinati pollster Al Tuchfarber said the polls to watch would be those conducted in early September.</p>
<p>&quot;If Dole is within eight to 12 points of Clinton, this will be a very close and exciting race,&quot; he said. He cited three factors that could help Dole:</p>
<p>-- Polls of registered voters, as opposed to likely voters, tend to underestimate Republican support. Most polls being conducted now are of registered voters.</p>
<p>-- Undecided voters tend to break for the challenger rather than the incumbent at the last minute.</p>
<p>-- If support for Perot stays in single digits, his support may crumble in the final days of the campaign, with most of it going to Dole.</p>
<p>&quot;I suspect when the dust settles after the Democratic convention next week, Clinton will emerge with an eight- to 10-point lead,&quot; said John Geer, an expert on public opinion trends with Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee.</p>
