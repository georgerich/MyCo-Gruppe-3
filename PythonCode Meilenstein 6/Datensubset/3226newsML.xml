<p>Russia's Federal Property Fund is seeking investment of more than $77 million in two investment tenders for a combined 34 percent of oil company  OAO Sibneft.</p>
<p>The fund plans to tender a first lot of 19 percent of the company next month, with the winner announced on September 20.</p>
<p>The starting price for the 858.12 million shares is 82.38 billion roubles but the winner must also agree to invest the rouble equivalent of at least $43.484 million, according to the latest issue of the fund's Reforma bulletin.</p>
<p>A second lot of 15 percent of Sibneft would be tendered separately. Details of the starting price for this lot were not revealed but the minimum investment would be $33.56 million.</p>
<p>Russia announced plans in May to sell 34 percent of five oil copmpanies, including Sibneft, this year.</p>
<p>Foreign ownership in Sibneft is restricted to 15 percent of the capital, Reforma said.</p>
<p>The terms of the first tender say the winner must invest $40.684 million in Sibneft and its associated companies within three years of winning the tender.</p>
<p>But the winner must also pay the equivalent of $2.8 million to cover the company's tax debts.</p>
<p>OAO Sibirskaya Neftyanaya Kompaniya (Sibneft) is one of a dozen vertically integrated Russian oil groups. Its main operating unit is AO Noyabrskneftegaz.</p>
<p>Sibneft's oil output was 20.35 million tonnes in 1995, after 22.68 million in 1994.</p>
<p>The previously unknown ZAO Neftyanaya Kompaniya and Stolichny Bank Sberezhenii won control of a 51 percent stake in Sibneft at the end of last year under the government's shares-for-loans scheme.</p>
<p>Their bid of $100.3 million was guaranteed by Bank Menatep.</p>
<p>A consortium of banks, including Inkombank, submitted a higher bid which was rejected because it was wrongly formulated, privatisation officials said.</p>
<p>Inkombank took the case to court but said last month it had lost on appeal.</p>
