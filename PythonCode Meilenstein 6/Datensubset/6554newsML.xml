<p>Swedish industrial investment group Incentive confirmed on Wednesday media reports that it was mulling the sale of its Hagglunds Vehicle unit, but added a decision was not imminent.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not a new story, strategically the unit does not belong to our core business,&quot; Incentive spokesman Bengt Modeer told Reuters, adding that the company would now concentrate on developing businesses such as its wholly-owned drugs unit Gambro.</p>
<p>Modeer said Incentive was not in a hurry to dispose of the military vehicle operation but would wait for the right buyer and the right price.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to sell to a good new owner, it doesn't matter whether it's Swedish or not, as long as our criteria are met,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Incentive also plans to dispose of its 35 percent interest in U.S. brake component manufacturer Wabco acquired through the purchase of former investment group Cardo.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a profitable and well-run company, but we came over the holding through the Cardo deal, which was just a way of getting at the Gambro holding,&quot; Modeer said.</p>
