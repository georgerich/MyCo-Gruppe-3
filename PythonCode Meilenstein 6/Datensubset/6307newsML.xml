<p>Iran's health minister held talks with his Iraqi counterpart in Baghdad on Wednesday in a rare meeting between senior officials from the former war foes.</p>
<p>Iran's official news agency IRNA said Iraqi Health Minister Umeed Madhat Mubarak briefed Iran's Alireza Marandi about the health situation in Iraq and called on Tehran to assist his country in easing medical problems caused by six years of international sanctions against Baghdad.</p>
<p>Marandi said Iran was ready to provide medical expertise, help Iraq overcome its medicine shortages and cooperate in fighting contagious diseases, particularly in border areas, the agency said. It did not say when Marandi arrived in Iraq.</p>
<p>&quot;He (Marandi) condemned the unjust pressures which were exerted on Iraqi citizens and called on Mubarak to inspect Iran's medicare facilities upon his visit to Iran,&quot; IRNA added.</p>
<p>Iran has criticised the United Nations sanctions imposed against Iraq since its 1990 occupation of Kuwait but said it abides by them.</p>
<p>The rare meeting follows an exchange last week of the remains of 465 soldiers killed during the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war. It was was the second such exchange in two months.</p>
<p>Accounting for soldiers missing in action and prisoners of war are among the thorniest issues hindering efforts to improve ties between Tehran and Baghdad.</p>
<p>Iraq denies holding any Iranians and says more than 20,000 Iraqis are held in Iran. Tehran denies the Iraqi claims and says Baghdad is still holding 5,000 to 10,000 Iranian prisoners.</p>
