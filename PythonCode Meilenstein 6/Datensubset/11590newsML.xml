<headline>OPTIONS - Euro debt vols seen regrouping after fall.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-08-23</dateline>

<p>Implied volatility of European bond and interest rate options should stabilise around current levels until early next week after falling before and after this week's German-led cut in interest rates, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Volatility has come off a lot. We're looking for it to stabilise now,&quot; said one Euromark options trader at a U.S. bank.</p>
<p>A trader at a Japanese bank said Euromark volatility now stood at 14.00 for September contract, 16.75 for December, 19.50 for March and 21.25 for June.</p>
<p>This compared with midweek levels, before the welter of interest rate cuts, of 18.50 for September, 20.00 for December, 22.00 for March and 23.5 for June, he said.</p>
<p>At 1347 GMT, December Euromark futures were trading at 96.78, two basis points down on the day.</p>
<p>He said the sell-off in June vols might have been overdone, which could offer value at current levels.</p>
<p>He said caps and floors would be well bid after the round of interest rate cuts due to the fact these rates should stay low at the short end. The size of the Bundesbank's repo rate cut, to 3.00 percent from 3.30 percent, took markets by surprise.</p>
<p>&quot;Volatility has a bid to it -- longer-dated volatility more than short-dated because the event people were buying for has passed and now perhaps people will sell some short dated vol and buy some long dated vol,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Long dated volatility has been low this year, so it is still at levels which are not historically high.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not a dangerous level to own vol. You are not going to lose a lot and you could make quite a bit.&quot;</p>
<p>He said volatility levels should be stable until markets reassess the situation after a long weekend in Britain.</p>
<p>Paribas Capital Markets OTC options specialist Robert Coughlan said that if volatility continued lower for the rest of Friday in over-the-counter 10-year Bunds, it should be higher next Tuesday.</p>
<p>He said the absence on holiday of many market makers was a main factor behind falls this week in volatility in high-yielding markets such as Italy, Spain and Sweden.</p>
<p>Coughlan said the market had more downside than upside potential, but a fall was not likely to be of significant size.</p>
<p>&quot;I recommend people sell strangles in a number of markets -- in Germany and France in particular.</p>
<p>&quot;With high-yielding markets Italy will be a lot more vulnerable in September on economic and political fronts, so I would use current the low level of vol to buy options.</p>
<p>&quot;So sell options on Bunds and France to enhance yield and buy options on Italy,&quot; Coughlan said..</p>
