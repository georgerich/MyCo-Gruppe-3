<headline>DUTCH BOSKALIS H1 PROFIT DOWN BUT ORDER BOOK UP.</headline>

<p>Dutch dredger Boskalis announced a drop in first-half net profit on Friday, but said its well-filled order book would ensure a better performance in the rest of this year.</p>
<p>First-half net profits fell to 27.5 million guilders from a year-earlier 41.4 million, pressured by the long winter in north western Europe and the difficult situation on the world dredging market in 1995.</p>
<p>The earnings were towards the lower end of the forecast range. Analysts polled by Reuters had seen first-half net of 18.3 to 37.3 million guilders, with consensus at 30.1 million.</p>
<p>The first-half number was well-received on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, with Boskalis shares initially putting on 1.60 guilders to 30.00 guilders. The shares later fell back to 29 guilders before rallying to close at the day's high of 30.60.</p>
<p>The brief dip followed the release of the full text of the company's press statement, reflecting there had been some confusion among market players about a summary of the full-year forecast issued via the Amsterdam Stock Exchange's newsfeed.</p>
<p>The full text showed Boskalis' expectations of improved profits and turnover only applied to the second half of 1996 relative to the first half of the year.</p>
<p>The dredger said that based on its order book at June 30 it expected capacity utilisation, turnover and profit in the second half to be better than in the first half.</p>
<p>But it added, &quot;whether for the whole of 1996 the same level of operating result and net result as for 1995 can be achieved is uncertain&quot;. Full-year 1995 net profits amounted to 70.9 million guilders.</p>
<p>Boskalis clinched 950 million guilders in new orders in the first half, taking its order book to 1.34 billion guilders at end-June from 881 million guilders at the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>It said the dredging market had improved strongly in the first half, particularly for trailing suction hopper dredgers.</p>
<p>&quot;Contracts for a number of substantial projects in the Far East have ensured a solid fleet occupancy level as from the second half of 1996,&quot; Boskalis said.</p>
<p>In March, Boskalis secured a 200 million guilder order for some four years' dredging work at Singapore's Changi airport.</p>
<p>In addition the market in the Netherlands had developed well and this, coupled with &quot;satisfactory&quot; markets in Central and South America, meant prices had shown some improvement, it said.</p>
<p>But Boskalis added the situation was still unsatisfactory in several other markets such as Germany and Nigeria and the offshore market for precision rock placement.</p>
<p>&quot;In view of the good market prospects, especially for large harbour and land reclamation projects, the fleet renewal programme will be further intensified,&quot; Boskalis added.</p>
<p>The company is due to take delivery of a new jumbo hopper suction dredger in several months, which will be used on the Changi project.</p>
