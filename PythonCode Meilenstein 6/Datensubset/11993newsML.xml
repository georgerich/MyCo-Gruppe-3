<p>The European Union appears ready to help cover a large sale of barley to Saudi Arabia if prices are in line with Thursday's sale of 34,277 tonnes of German barley, member country officials said on Friday.</p>
<p>At its weekly grain tender on Thursday the Commission sold the grain at a minimum price of 109.36 Ecus per tonne, seen worth $149 per tone fob, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;Through the sale, the Commission has marked the level of a (future) Saudi sale,&quot; one official told Reuters.</p>
<p>This meant the Commission was reluctant to part with its barley for less than $149-150 per tonne, fob, he added.</p>
<p>Deals to sell 800,000 tonnes of barley to Saudi Arabia are basically wrapped up but suppliers are still awaiting formal confirmation, which could take several days, European and North American exporters said earlier.</p>
<p>Deals are priced at around $160-$162 per tonne including cost, freight and insurance, which equates to $144-$146 fob Europe -- below the &quot;floor&quot; set by the Commission.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia tendered on August 21 for 250,000 tonnes of the grain for September 25 arrival and 550,000 tonnes for delivery by October 15.</p>
<p>The European Commission decided not to reveal its hand on how much barley it would make available for Saudi Arabia pending confirmation of the tender results and greater clarity over the pricing, officials said.</p>
<p>Traders had expected it to allocate an extra 150,000 tonnes of German intervention barley for export -- some were lobbying for as much as 300,000 tonnes -- but the decision must now await next week's grain panel. The current unsold German barley allocation is 283,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>EU officials said earlier it was too early to address the Saudi business.</p>
