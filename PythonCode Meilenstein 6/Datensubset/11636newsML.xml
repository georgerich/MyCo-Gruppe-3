<title>UK: IBCA cuts Yorkshire Water ratings.</title>
<headline>IBCA cuts Yorkshire Water ratings.</headline>

<p>IBCA, the European credit rating agency, said on Friday it had removed Yorkshire Water's long-term rating of AA minus and short-term rating of A1 plus from RatingWatch and downgraded them to A plus and A1 respectively.  </p>
<p>IBCA said the action followed direct intervention by Ofwat in June 1996, which it said was  likely to have a material impact on the group's business outlook.</p>
<p>&quot;The regulator's actions will not have a significant impact on profits but the longer term implication is that failure to perform to Ofwat's required standards may cause further regulatory action,&quot; it said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;In addition, the increased capital expenditure needed by Yorkshire Water to meet these standards will raise both debt and gearing above planned levels.&quot;  </p>
<p>IBCA said Yorkshire Water was to discontinue all non-regulated activities other than waste management and property activities relating to its own assets, making it one of only two independent companies within the industry to be focused virtually exclusively on water-related services.</p>
<p>&quot;Whether this strategy is sustainable in the long term remains to be seen,&quot; IBCA said. &quot;There will be a decline in coverages over the next four years. However, debt levels and gearing remain satisfactory for a company within the single A range.&quot;</p>
