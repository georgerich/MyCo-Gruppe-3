<p>Voters in Juneau, Alaska's capital, will be asked in October whether the city should charge a $7 fee for each visiting cruise-ship passenger.</p>
<p>The passenger fee is being promoted by a group of residents who believe swelling crowds from cruise ships are squeezing public services in the picturesque port city of 30,000.</p>
<p>&quot;All of the municipal budgets are strained by it,&quot; said Judy Crondahl, a leader of Juneau Values Responsible Tourism, the group that gathered enough petition signatures to place the measure on the ballot in the city's October 1 municipal election.</p>
<p>Crondahl, operator of a bed-and-breakfast inn, said visitors who stay overnight in Juneau hotels pay an 11 percent tax, while the cruise ship passengers pay no similar fee.</p>
<p>&quot;People come in off the cruise ships and they're using the same services and not paying a commensurate amount for it,&quot; she said Wednesday.</p>
<p>It is unlikely that the fee would diminish Juneau's appeal as a cruise destination, Crondahl said.</p>
<p>&quot;People pay several thousands of dollars when they come up here on a cruise ship. Seven dollars is not going to deter anybody,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>The capital city is expected to host 469,000 cruise ship passengers this year, according to the Juneau Convention and Visitors Bureau.</p>
<p>Cruise-ship visitation has surged in the past 10 years, the bureau reports. In 1986, only 181,000 people visited Juneau by cruise ship, according to the bureau.</p>
<p>Members of the Juneau Convention and Visitors Bureau overwhelmingly oppose the passenger fee, said Susan Bell, president of the organization. Of 114 members who responded to a survey, 95 opposed the measure, she said.</p>
<p>Their concern was that &quot;to just target cruise ship passengers is not a fair and balanced approach,&quot; Bell said.</p>
<p>Crondahl's group gathered 2,765 valid petition signatures, exceeding the required 2,521, said Evelyn Stott, a spokeswoman for the Juneau clerk's office.</p>
<p>The measure would exempt ships for 20 or fewer passengers, ships with no overnight accommodations, non-commercial ships and vessels operated by the state, federal or foreign governments,  The October 1 ballot will also feature a $3.19 million school bond issue, Stott sa    --U.S. Municipal Desk, 212-859-1650</p>
