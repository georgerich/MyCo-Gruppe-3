<headline>PRESS DIGEST - RUSSIA - AUG 22.</headline>
<text>
<p>IZVESTIA</p>
<p>- The fact that for two days running there has been no reaction from the Russian leadership to the promise of an all-out assault on separatist positions in Grozny by the Russian command in Chechnya means that either the military will try the impossible -- to get the capital back from the rebels -- or that they are out of control.</p>
<p>- Tens of thousands of frightened civilians flee Grozny after the military promises more destruction.</p>
<p>- Millions of Russian holiday-makers and businessmen wait with trepidation for the news on a planned strike by aviation workers promised to paralyse the country.</p>
<p>PRAVDA</p>
<p>- National security advisor Alexander Lebed's visit to Chechnya will put an end to renewed fighting there.</p>
<p>SEVODNYA</p>
<p>- The long history of Russia's failed attempts to tackle the Chechen crisis casts doubt on the &quot;optimistic hypothesis&quot; that its latest moves in the region are parts of a thoroughly thought-out peace plan.</p>
<p>- President Yeltsin, contrary to persistant rumours, has not only NOT been taken to hospital but feels much better after a short break from work in Russia's Valdai lake region, says the paper, quoting confidential sources.</p>
<p>- The new Russian government is to discuss the 1997 budget at its first official meeting today.</p>
<p>NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA</p>
<p>- A string of last-minute presidential decrees and government instructions to improve tax collection and abolish tax breaks have produced a favourable impression on International Monetary Fund officials who concluded that Russia's economic performance was satisfactory.</p>
<p>ROSSIISKIYE VESTI</p>
<p>- Russian soldiers operating multiple rocket launchers in Grozny have been given enough ammunition to wipe half the city off the map.</p>
<p>MOSKOVSKY KOMSOMOLETS</p>
<p>- Too many people make too much money on the war in Chechnya and as long as that is the case there will be no peace in the rebel republic, says the paper.</p>
