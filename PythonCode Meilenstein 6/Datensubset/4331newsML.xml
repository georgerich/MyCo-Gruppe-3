<p>Germany's Bundesbank is likely to lower its main money market interest rate this week, finally following through on a promise made in April to cut the rate when conditions allowed, economists said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>They said a marked slowdown in the headline growth rate for M3 money supply in July, combined with low inflation and an uneasy economic upturn, meant that the climate was now right for a cut of up to 10-20 basis points in the repo rate.</p>
<p>In a Reuter poll of 10 economists, eight believed a small cut in the 3.30 percent rate was on the cards when the central bank council meets on Thursday after a four-week summer break.</p>
<p>&quot;An interest rate cut is appropriate. The M3 figures were in line with expectations and would not block a repo easing,&quot; said Norbert Braems, senior economist at BZW in Frankfurt.</p>
<p>The Bundesbank said today annualised M3 money supply growth dropped to 8.6 percent in July from 9.6 percent in June.</p>
<p>Inflation has been running at about 1.5 percent for several months and there is no fear of it gaining pace any time soon.</p>
<p>Although July's M3 growth was still above a seven percent target ceiling, analysts said the figure was encouraging as it meant the central bank could reach its goal by the year-end.</p>
<p>Signs of a slowdown in M3 were a stated condition for the Bundesbank to lower the repo rate, the rate at which central bank funds are made available to German banks.</p>
<p>The rate has been held at 3.30 percent since February, even though the central bank lowered official discount and Lombard rates -- the floor and ceiling for money market rates -- to 2.50 and 4.50 percent respectively in April.</p>
<p>Ulrich Beckmann at DB Research responded warmly to the M3 data. &quot;It was at the lower end of our expectation, which was 8.6 to 9.1 percent,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is now very clear that we have a very good chance to reach the Bundesbank target zone (of four to seven percent growth for 1996). I think there is a very good chance that we will see a cut in the repo rate,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Uwe Angenendt, economist at BHF-Bank in Frankfurt, agreed. &quot;Monetary expansion has slowed considerably. This is a very good sign for the Bundesbank on Thursday. I expect a repo rate cut of 10 to 20 basis points.&quot;</p>
<p>But economists said the final decision could depend on consumer confidence data from the respected Ifo institute, due on Wednesday. Economists expect the business climate index to show at best a small improvement in July.</p>
<p>&quot;M3 will help to argue for cut. But tomorrow's Ifo figures will be more influential as far as a repo cut is concerned,&quot; said Ros Lifton at Daiwa Europe in London.</p>
<p>Analysts expect the index to climb slightly to around 91.0, after hitting a three-month low at 90.4 in June.</p>
<p>Although the Bundesbank does not follow an anti-cyclical policy -- lowering rates at any sign of economic weakness -- the current low-inflation environment leaves the Bundesbank fairly free to use its policy to help the economic recovery.</p>
<p>It often refers to Ifo data in its reports.</p>
<p>&quot;The Bundesbank will not have any better arguments for easing rates in future than on Thursday,&quot; said Norbert Meissner at Caisse des Depots et Consignations in Frankfurt.</p>
<p>&quot;The inflationary environment is good and if the Bundesbank wants to help the economy it had better act now.&quot;</p>
<p>But a minority of economists, possibly wary that the central bank appeared four weeks ago to prepare markets for a repo cut, but then failed to deliver the goods, said they had now given up expecting a further easing at all this cycle.</p>
<p>Armin Kayser at SBC Warburg said he was also extremely sceptical there would be any economic impact from such a move.</p>
<p>&quot;A cut by a few basis points will not stimulate the economy and it may be that the economy doesn't even need it,&quot; he said.</p>
