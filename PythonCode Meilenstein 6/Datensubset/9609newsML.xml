<p>Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole on Thursday vowed to send President Bill Clinton into retirement and as an incentive he promised the Democratic incumbent a 15 percent tax cut.</p>
<p>Under a Dole presidency, Democrats would get the tax cut &quot;whether they like it or not,&quot; Dole told a rally. &quot;Even former President Clinton will get a tax cut next year whether he likes it or not.&quot;</p>
<p>In a brief speech at an old-fashioned bandstand in a leafy suburban park, Dole repeated the centrepiece of his campaign -- a 15 percent across-the-board income tax cut, slashes in capital gains taxes and a balanced federal budget.</p>
<p>Critics have said it would be impossible to balance the budget while cutting taxes without eviscerating social programmes, but Dole said he could do it. He did not elaborate on how he would do so.</p>
<p>But he and running mate Jack Kemp said the experience of New Jersey showed that the Democrats were wrong, that it is possible to cut taxes while balancing the budget.</p>
<p>&quot;We are going to do it ... We are going to balance the budget while cutting taxes and it can be done, you can do both,&quot; Dole declared to a small but enthusiastic rally that he dubbed &quot;Clinton's retirement party.&quot;</p>
<p>To sceptics, Dole cited popular New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, who has cut state income taxes by 30 percent since taking office in January 1994. Whitman, campaigning alongside Dole in this state of moderate swing-voters, attributed 135,000 new jobs in New Jersey during her administration to her economic policies.</p>
<p>&quot;The Democrats say that you can't balance a budget and cut taxes at the same time. We know you can because you are doing it in New Jersey. Bob Dole knows what America needs and it isn't four more years of 'Broken promises Bill,'&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Dole said his message was &quot;very simple.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This country deserves to do better. That's the message we have. We're going to take it all across America.&quot;</p>
<p>Kemp, who has accompanied Dole and kept up the campaign energy since the San Diego convention, told the audience to stop thinking of the Republicans as the &quot;Grand Old Party&quot; and start regarding it as &quot;the Grand Opportunity Party.&quot;</p>
<p>Dole has edged to just five points behind Clinton since the announcement of his tax cut plan, the choice of Kemp as running mate and the successful Republican convention, a Reuters poll said. The poll, released on Thursday, showed 41.5 percent supported Clinton and 36.3 percent Dole -- a gap of just 5.2 percentage points. Texas billionaire Ross Perot got 7.4 percent.</p>
