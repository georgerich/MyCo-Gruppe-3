<p>A 90-cent increase in the U.S. minimum wage will have little short-term impact on most fast food restaurants, since the competition for workers is keeping pay rates above the federally mandated standard.</p>
<p>&quot;The (real) 'minimum wage' is what the closest McDonald's pays or it could be the local Pizza Hut,&quot; George Goulson, senior vice president of A&amp;W Restaurants Inc, said.</p>
<p>But longer term, the industry fears that workers, who are already making more than the new minimum wage, will be looking for a raise to maintain the pay premium.  </p>
<p>Earlier Tuesday, President Clinton signed into law the first rise in the minimum wage in five years, boosting the wage to $5.15 an hour from $4.25.</p>
<p>&quot;Our average crew wage is about $5.20 (an hour) so short-term there is not going to be any impact,&quot; said Denny Lynch, spokesman for Wendy's International Inc, which operates 4,307 restaurants in the United States.</p>
<p>But higher minimum wages will raise total wages by about $500,000 over the next 12 months at American Restaurant Partners L.P., which operates 62 Pizza Hut restaurant franchises.  </p>
<p>&quot;If you raise someone who started in the last two months (to the new minimum wage level), you also have to raise everybody else,&quot; said Terry Freund, chief financial officer of American Restaurant Partners.</p>
<p>Beyond the minimum wage requirements, competition for workers, from cooks to delivery drivers, has forced many fast-food chains to pay up to hire good help, particularly in metropolitan markets. That competition is being driven by an increase in restaurant openings.</p>
<p>&quot;There are neighborhoods where we have to pay $6.00 an hour to $6.50 or $7.00 to get&quot; good workers, Lynch added.  </p>
<p>Fast-food industry executives said there has been competition for workers since the late 1980s, although the increase in restaurant openings is making the search for employees more intense.</p>
<p>Another problem for quick-service restaurants is that wage competition from other employers often lures experienced workers away. A fast-food worker, for example, may be able to bring home more pay as a waiter or waitress at a casual dining establishment where they could receive $50 or $60 a night in tips, executives said.</p>
<p>&quot;For QSRs (quick service restaurants)...it's even tougher to keep the kids,&quot; Roger Lipton, president of Lipton Financial Services, said.</p>
