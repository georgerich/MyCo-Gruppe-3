<p>London shares climbed to another record high on Tuesday led by renewed strength in retailing and oil stocks and following reassuring money supply from both the Britain and Germany.</p>
<p>The blue chip FTSE 100 index peaked at 3,883.4, 5-1/2 points up on its previous record set on Monday, after British M4, the broad measure of money supply, showed money growth remained subdued through July.</p>
<p>But trading interest was again muted and shares slipped back to 3,881.8 by late morning. Retailers provided the main impetus.</p>
<p>Markets were nervously awaiting the interest rate decisions from a Federal Reserve open market committee meeting later on Tuesday, and the Bundesbank's Council meeting on Thursday.</p>
<p>Given these worries, positive German money supply data failed to inspire the German stock market, which traded mixed after the Bundesbank announced slower growth of key M3 money supply figures and virtually guaranteed a cut in its key money market rate.</p>
<p>French stocks opened higher and breezed up 21 points, quickly pushing the index through the 2,000 barrier for the first time since August 8, on strengthened hopes of a new round of rate cuts.</p>
<p>Wall Street, also stilled by the FOMC meeting and general summer torpor, had its slowest full day of trade this year on Monday, which may have influenced Frankfurt's less than euphoric response to the money supply data.</p>
<p>Analysts said the British money supply figures would give further ammunition to Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke if he wants to trim the 5.75 percent base interest rate again in coming months.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a good figure...most people hadn't expected the figure to come back into the monitoring range, which is about the first time for six or seven months,&quot; said economist Keith Wade of Schroders.</p>
<p>In Germany, growth in M3, the German central bank's main policy guide, slowed to an annualised 8.6 percent in July from 9.6 percent in June.</p>
<p>&quot;It is now very clear that we have a very good chance to reach the Bundesbank target zone (of four to seven percent growth for 1996). I think there is a very good chance that we will see a cut in the repo rate,&quot; said Uwe Angenendt, economist at BHF-Bank in Frankfurt.</p>
<p>Assuming no change in U.S. interest rates, analysts expect germany's key money market, or repo, to be pared, although opinions vary as to the size of a possible cut.</p>
<p>The sleepy dollar was confined to narrow ranges throughout an extremely quiet European morning session, barely twitching an eyelid in reaction to a softer than generally expected German M3 number.</p>
<p>Volume was thin with few dealers willing to get involved.</p>
<p>&quot;OK, so the Fed probably won't move and the Bundesbank probably will, particularly after that good M3 number. But in this market you will get killed if you're wrong and have a big position,&quot; said one trader. &quot;I'm not taking the risk.&quot;</p>
<p>CURRENCIES  AT 1130 GMT</p>
<p>Dollar/mark was trading at 1.4902 and dollar/yen at 107.90 versus Monday's late 1.4875 and 107.90. Mark/French franc was trading at 3.4156 against 3.4232.</p>
