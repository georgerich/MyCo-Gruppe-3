<headline>Strong Dow, rate cut boost London stocks to record.</headline>

<p>London shares climbed through a key psychological level to a new peak on Friday after the German Bundesbank triggered a wave of interest rate cuts through Europe and Wall Street performed strongly.</p>
<p>London's bluechip FTSE 100 index rose to a record of 3,911 points, helped by the Dow's 43-point advance, but later drifted a few points lower.</p>
<p>German shares advanced modestly on the back of Thursday's gains, but French stocks slipped after opening firm.</p>
<p>The dollar's early boost from the Bundesbank's surprisingly big cut in its securities repurchase, or repo, rate on Thursday quickly ran out of steam.</p>
<p>German government bonds were firmer in early trade, but dealers predicted they would consolidate after the gains that followed the repo cut. The German market helped British government bond, or gilt, futures to firm by a quarter point.</p>
<p>With a long weekend coming up in Britain, dealers said the equity and foreign exchange markets would remain cautious.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a squeezy market. But the fact that its gone through 3,900 in a reasonably big way is encouraging,&quot; one equities trader said about the stocks advance.</p>
<p>Second line stocks were also higher, with the Mid-250 scoring a 9.1 points gain at 4,411.6, but standing nearly 160 points below its best closing level made in late April.</p>
<p>Dealers said they were waiting for Wall Street's opening for confirmation of the New York market's resolve to push higher. U.S. durable goods data for July are due at 1230 GMT.</p>
<p>French shares fell 3.6 points after opening slightly higher on the back of Thursday's big gains.</p>
<p>&quot;If the U.S. market will rise further today we could hold, otherwise we rise to see some declines due to profit-taking,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>Promodes rose 3.39 percent to 1,280 francs after the Les Echos newspaper reported the retailer could sell its German assets to Spar AG as soon as next Tuesday.</p>
<p>German shares opened bourse trade steady, buoyed by the Bundesbank's rate cut and the strong finish on Wall Street.</p>
<p>Dealers said they expected German shares to trade higher over the session, but more substantial gains are likely early next week.</p>
<p>The dollar's failure to get above technical resistance pegged around 1.4950-60 marks disappointed the market.</p>
<p>&quot;The dollar has failed to gain any meaningful momentum on the back of the Bundesbank's larger than expected rate cut and is unlikely to do so in the near future,&quot; said Klaus Baader, senior currency economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.</p>
<p>&quot;In our view the short-term risks are now very much skewed to the downside for dollar/mark.&quot;</p>
<p>At 0915 GMT the dollar was at 1.4904 marks and 108.38 yen compared with 1.4935 marks and 108.43 yen at the London close on Thursday.</p>
