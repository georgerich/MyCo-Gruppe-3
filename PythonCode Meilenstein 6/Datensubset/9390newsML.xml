<p>China's central bank will cut its interest rates on loans to commercial banks, state television said on Thursday.</p>
<p>It gave no indication of when or how much it would trim rates.</p>
<p>The People's Bank of China currently lends to commercial banks at an annual rate of nine percent on 20-day funds, 10.08 percent for three-month funds, 10.17 percent for six months and 10.98 percent for one year money.</p>
<p>The official Xinhua news agency reported earlier on Thursday that the People's Bank, which sets commercial bank interest rate levels, would cut interest on commercial bank deposits by an average of 1.5 percentage points and lending rates by 1.2 percentage points.</p>
<p>State television also referred to &quot;appropriate adjustments&quot; to be made on rates paid on commercial bank deposits with the central bank. It gave no details, but the central bank currently pays 8.82 percent annually on two types of reserves that commercial banks must keep on deposit with the central bank.</p>
<p>China reduced interest rates in May, and analysts had forecast another cut this year as domestic inflation eased.</p>
