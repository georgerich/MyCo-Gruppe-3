<text>
<p>National Semiconductor Corp. said Tuesday it is cutting its headquarters work force by 170 people.</p>
<p>The computer chip maker, which has 20,000 employees worldwide, said in June that it expected some layoffs as part of &quot;cost containment&quot; measures associated with the spin-off of its new unit, Fairchild Semiconductor.</p>
<p>At the time, National Semiconductor said it expected to take a charge of $280 million to $320 million in the current quarter, in part to cover the cost of the work-force reductions.</p>
<p>The job cuts were mainly in the administrative and manufacturing support areas. Dick Wilson, vice president of human resources, said the cutbacks were an attempt to cut costs as well as centralize the company's operations.</p>
<p>The company reported sales of $2.6 billion in fiscal 1996.</p>
<p>Shares of National Semiconductor were unchanged at $15.875 at the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
