<p>Palestinians said Israel's right-wing government had barred Yasser Arafat from flying by helicopter to the West Bank on Thursday for a meeting with former Israeli leader Shimon Peres.</p>
<p>&quot;The Palestinian side was informed that Arafat won't be allowed to fly to Ramallah because he was supposed to meet Peres later in the day,&quot; a senior Palestinian security source in the West Bank town of Ramallah told Reuters.</p>
<p>Palestinians said that Arafat had cancelled an Israeli-PLO meeting on civilian affairs in protest but that the Palestinian leader would meet Peres anyway, in self-ruled Gaza.</p>
<p>Palestinian peace negotiator Hassan Asfour charged that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has accused opposition Labour party leader Peres of trying to undermine his Likud government's authority, of personally barring the flight.</p>
<p>An Israeli army spokesman quoted Herzl Getz, chief of Israel's Security Liaison Committee with the Palestinians, as saying all technical details relating to the flight, which must fly over Israeli territory, had been approved by the military.</p>
<p>&quot;We are still waiting for permission from the political level,&quot; the spokesman quoted Getz as saying. There was no immediate comment from Netanyahu's office or from Peres.</p>
<p>A Palestinian security source described Palestinian President Arafat as &quot;furious&quot; over the alleged Israeli ban.</p>
<p>Palestinian council speaker Ahmed Korei said the ban was a &quot;flagrant violation&quot; of an agreement allowing Arafat to fly between self-ruled enclaves under PLO control.</p>
<p>He said Arafat had previously flown between Gaza and the West Bank in an Egyptian helicopter but that Thursday's flight was to be the first in a Palestinian aircraft.</p>
<p>Israel Army radio quoted Israeli defence officials as saying Israel had yet to complete safety checks on the Palestinian helicopter.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe that this is only an attempt to insult the Palestinian people by delaying and obstructing the work of the president,&quot; Korei told Reuters.</p>
<p>Arafat was also supposed to attend a meeting in Ramallah of the Palestinian legislature.</p>
<p>&quot;Netanyahu behaves as a military governor and not as a political leader,&quot; Asfour said.</p>
<p>The prime minister, who opposes trading occupied land for peace, has refused to meet Arafat since taking office in June vowing to pursue peace vigorously.</p>
<p>Netanyahu has accused Nobel peace laureate Peres of &quot;sticking spokes in the wheels of peace&quot; by meeting Arab leaders while in opposition.</p>
<p>Peres and Palestinian architects of the Israeli-PLO peace accords on Tuesday set up a watchdog group to monitor implementation of the deal they said was threatened by Netanyahu's election.</p>
<p>Government officials boycotted the gathering.</p>
