<p>The United States welcomed the deal reached on Thursday between Russian authorities and Chechen rebels to end the fighting in Chechnya and said it hoped it would lead to a political settlement.</p>
<p>&quot;We welcome this agreememnt. We look forward to its implementation by both parties and hope it leads to a political settlement of the Chechen crisis,&quot; State Department spokesman Glyn Davies told reporters.  </p>
<p>Davies said the agreement, reached by Russian President Boris Yeltsin's security supremo Alexander Lebed and Chechen rebel chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov at a village south of the Chechen capital Grozny, included a ban on all hostilities.</p>
<p>The sides also agreed to a partial pullout of forces from Grozny, to set up joint military patrols in the devastated city and to list the present location of their warring forces as well as routes and deadlines for the troop pullout, he said.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands have died since Moscow sent troops and armour in December 1994 to quell Chechnya's independence bid.</p>
<p>A series of attempts to end fighting have collapsed as the sides could not agree on the future of the mountainous region. The separatists seek full independence from Moscow while the Kremlin wants Chechnya to remain part of the Russia Federation.</p>
