<title>USA: Sprint to enter Internet race - WS Journal.</title>
<headline>Sprint to enter Internet race - WS Journal.</headline>

<p>Sprint Corp is expected to enter the race to make the Internet as widespread for customers as the telephone, The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The telecommunications giant, which has 15 million customers and nearly $13 billion in annual revenue, plans to announce on Tuesday a new Internet-access service for consumers, a Sprint executive said.</p>
<p>Though Sprint has been operating a major portion of the Internet since 1992 to serve businesses, the Kansas City, Mo., company has yet to target residential customers, a move that many industry watchers have been waiting for.</p>
<p>The move follows those by several other telecommunications companies that have set their sights on the Internet, ranging from regional Bell operating companies to MCI Communications Corp and AT&amp;T Corp.</p>
<p>Sprint will roll out its service in phases. Beginning on Tuesday, the company will invite 200,000 of its residential long-distance customers to use the service for free until it is made available to the general public in the autumn.</p>
<p>Like its rivals, Sprint will ultimately charge users $19.95 for unlimited monthly usage. Users can also opt for a pay-as-you-go plan whereby they would not pay for a month of service if they did not use it.</p>
<p>Sprint executives expect their service will be used by 20 percent of the Internet's customers with a year, although they decline to quantify that number.</p>
