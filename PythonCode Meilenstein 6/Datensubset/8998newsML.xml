<p>Business was slow on the London Metal Exchange (LME) close on Thursday in a market subdued by the summer holidays.</p>
<p>&quot;It's routine and activity is unlikely to pick up until September when consumer activity and demand is expected to blossom,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>The trader said the upcoming long UK holiday weekend and the US Labour Day next week is likely to keep prices within their recent well worn ranges.</p>
<p>Recent market leader copper failed to shine, remaining confined in a tight range of between $1,929 and $1,939.</p>
<p>Benchmark three months delivery ended the kerb at $1,935, down $1 from Wednesday's close.</p>
<p>Nearby spreads continued to be the main feature, with the September copper spreads holding main attention.</p>
<p>Sept/one day hovered at $3/$4 backwardation, Sept/threes near $39, while Sept/Oct stood at $20.</p>
<p>Outright cash to three months was uninspiring at a $38 backwardation.</p>
<p>The range of between $1,900 and $1,970 looks unlikely to be breached near-term, traders said.</p>
<p>A lack of physical demand led to technical trading in other base metals.</p>
<p>Aluminium, entrenched in a band between $1,484 and $1,490, matched copper's uninspiring session.</p>
<p>It was last at $1,487, down $3.</p>
<p>Nickel boosted by trade buying and buy-stop activity extended its recent rally above resistance at $7,300, though late bouts of profit-taking restricted further gains.</p>
<p>It was last at $7,360, versus $7,250.</p>
<p>Zinc clawed higher to finish at $1,030, up $8.</p>
<p>Lead was last at $818, down $2, while tin was little moved at $6,165. Alloy was stable at $1,285/90.</p>
