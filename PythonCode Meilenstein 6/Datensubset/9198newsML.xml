<p>Polish shares rose for the sixth session running but analysts said the slightly stronger selling after price fixing showed the market losing steam on Friday and made it unclear if a significant growth trend would follow.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems we now have a tug-of-war between buyers and sellers,&quot; said Krzysztof Rogalski, an analyst at Bank Staropolski SA brokerage.</p>
<p>Analysts said recent systematic gains in higher turnovers by several large-cap stocks was a good sign that could help return the market toward recent highs next week after its previous three weeks of stabilisation.  </p>
<p>&quot;Nothing had happened on the market for a long time so I think buying of some forgotten stocks could bring the market toward its latest (27-month, 14,282-point) high next week,&quot; said Artur Nagorka, a trader at Wood &amp; Company.</p>
<p>The main market's all-share WIG index rose 2.9 percent to 13,597.4 points and turnover rose 15 percent to 119.8 million zlotys on both markets.</p>
<p>Staropolski's Rogalski said current buying was more speculative, pointing to Thursday's 5.2-percent surge by the parallel market of smaller stocks, and said a larger inflow of foreign capital to spur a big rise would only come later.  </p>
<p>Analysts said BRE and Gorazdze, which rose in active trade by four and 3.1 percent on Thursday, were examples of large-stock rises which could buoy the market.</p>
<p>Analysts said top gainer Elektromontaz Export enjoyed a speculative 9.3-percent surge but may have also been helped by winning a $1.3 million contract on Wednesday.</p>
<p>They said biggest loser Prochnik, down 9.7 percent, fell in profit taking after its previous 7.3-percent jump. Mass privatisation NFI units fell 1.1 percent to 90 zlotys and fell 1.1 percent to 89 zlotys in continuous trade, where no stocks traded.</p>
