<p>A Middle East economic conference planned for Cairo in November may not take place on time, the Egyptian government newspaper al-Ahram said on Friday.</p>
<p>Even if it does take place, it will be doomed to failure unless Israel changes its attitude towards its neighbours, al-Ahram editor Ibrahim Nafie said in a front-page editorial.</p>
<p>In a speech on Thursday, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak showed signs of cold feet about the conference, saying many Middle East states would not attend unless Israel ensured that the Middle East peace process moved forward.</p>
<p>The conference, designed to promote economic integration in the region, would then be pointless, Mubarak said.</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Mubarak later on Thursday and assured him that Israel would resume negotiations soon with the Palestinians.</p>
<p>The al-Ahram editor, a pillar of the Egyptian ruling establishment, said that normal relations with Israel would not be possible if the present stalemate and tension continued.</p>
<p>&quot;Whether the conference takes place on time or not, Israel's settlement activity and its failure to meet its commitments will make the failure of the conference inevitable,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;In this case Israel must bear full responsibility for its failure if it (the conference) does convene,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Nafie said Netanyahu was repeating what he called a historical mistake made by earlier Israeli governments.</p>
<p>&quot;The mistake is to imagine that there can be peace in the region without hard work...in the erroneous belief that the other parties are just lifeless corpses or that Israel's relations with the Washington can be an alternative to cordial and normal relations with the states of the region,&quot; he said.</p>
