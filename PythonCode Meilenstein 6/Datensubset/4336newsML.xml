<title>NETHERLANDS: Dutch closing share market report.</title>
<headline>Dutch closing share market report.</headline>

<p>Dutch shares closed near the day's highs on Tuesday as the market gleaned confidence from German M3 data and expectations of positive corporate news.</p>
<p>The AEX index closed up 4.87 points at 565.72, just off the day's high of 565.89.</p>
<p>Dealers said the index may push to its all-time high around 572 points towards the end of the week, where it would likely meet solid resistance and some profit taking.</p>
<p>But cash piles and evidence of investors buying on dips indicate the downside potential may be limited, dealers said.  </p>
<p>Dealers said the slowdown in German July M3 money supply growth to 8.6 percent was positive for the market, keeping expectations of a repo rate cut alive.</p>
<p>Analysts said Buba may trim the repo by up to 10 basis points on Thursday, but that the market impact may not be great.</p>
<p>The market was firmly focused on the outcome of the U.S. FOMC meeting, due around 1815 GMT, although analysts were united in expecting no rate change.</p>
<p>The major corporate news was confined to first half results at Pakhoed and Van Ommeren.  </p>
<p>Pakhoed shares steamed five percent higher after an initial fall as investors digested an unexpectedly low 4.6 million guilder first half net.</p>
<p>The firm also announced a 54.3 million guilder extraordinary charge. The stock closed up 1.70 guilders at 46.30, off the day's high of 47.00 guilders.</p>
<p>Van Ommeren closed up 0.40 guilders at 65.50 after reporting H1 net of 44.7 million guilders, in line with expectations.</p>
<p>Nutricia shares powered to a new year high of 196 guilders during the day before dropping back to close up 2.40 guilders at 194.40. The company is to report first half results on Thursday.  </p>
<p>&quot;The figures will have to be extremely good to justify these prices,&quot; one dealer said, adding there may be some profit taking on the results.</p>
<p>Royal Dutch shares rose 2.40 guilders to 257.50 after a number of brokers reiterated buy recommendations on Shell Transport stock.</p>
<p>Nedlloyd was due to report on Wednesday with analysts expecting shipping operations to keep the group in the red. The stock closed up 0.50 guilders at 35.00.</p>
