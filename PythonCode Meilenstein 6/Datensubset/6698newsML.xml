<p>The upcoming expiry of September options sent shivers through the London cocoa ring on Wednesday as players weighed the risk of an out-of-the money declaration.</p>
<p>Particularly posing a threat were the 1,050 stg calls, which, being just 15 stg away from the futures price, could be exercised by longs trying to agitate the market, traders said.</p>
<p>Nervous dealings in anticipation of possible options-related short covering sent futures prices sharply higher in early trade as September leaped to a session high of 1,039 stg a tonne.</p>
<p>This was its highest level since July 10.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a risk 1,050 will be exercised,&quot; said one options trader. &quot;September is vulnerable to be tested at that level.&quot;</p>
<p>By the close on Tuesday, the open position on the 1,050 call was 970 lots, or 9,700 tonnes of cocoa, and puts were 850 lots.</p>
<p>Options holders have to decide whether to exercise their positions during Tuesday's midday interval from 1130 GMT.</p>
<p>Market turbulence stems from a hefty long position on the September futures contract of about 30,000 lots or 300,000 tonnes of cocoa, believed to be held by one big player.</p>
<p>The prospect of a record delivery in September had rallied September to an eight year high of 1,172 stg in June but a steady flow of cocoa from Ivory Coast eased the pressure.</p>
<p>But traders are now saying the long house could use the options as one of its last weapons to squeeze the market.</p>
<p>&quot;The market believes that the long holder has the 1,050, 1,100 and 1,200 strikes and he will try to push the market up to create new September shorts,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>This suggested that the 1,050 call could be exercised even if the futures price and the premium does not justify it.</p>
<p>&quot;I wouldn't be surprised. The long would be saying (to the shorts) you better find 10,000 tonnes of cocoa,&quot; said one.</p>
<p>But others disagreed, saying that the 1,050 strike was possibly controlled by a host of other players and a concerted action was difficult.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think the long house has more than 500 lots on 1,050 and that's not enough to squeeze the market,&quot; said another trader.</p>
<p>Traders said 1,100 calls where open interest is 1,092 lots could be another threat but an out-of-the-money exercise looks unlikely unless the futures market rises to that level.</p>
