<title>BRAZIL: Brazil shares end off on lack of news, trade weak.</title>
<headline>Brazil shares end off on lack of news, trade weak.</headline>
<dateline>SAO PAULO 1996-08-22</dateline>

<p>Brazilian stocks closed down 1.04 percent on one of the weakest daily volumes of the year as some local investors took advantage of a lull in market-moving news to take profits, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The bolsa was at a standstill today,&quot; one dealer said. &quot;It was lifeless.&quot;</p>
<p>The Sao Paulo bourse's Bovespa index of 52 most traded shares shed 659 points to close at 62,489 points on meager turnover of 245 million reais.  </p>
<p>Brokers said most blue chips declined in light trade, hit by mild profit-taking, as neither the Argentine or Brazilian Congress produced news and regional stock markets remained largely calm.</p>
<p>&quot;There was no perspective, no trend today,&quot; one broker said. &quot;There was no definition on Argentine's fiscal situation and our Congress do anything on reforms.&quot;</p>
<p>Prices suffered from the lack of interest in Brazilian shares with trade, as usual, focused on Telebras, dealers said.  </p>
<p>Its benchmark preferred ended off 0.92 percent at 75.60 percent, while the common fell 1.78 percent to 60.60 reais.</p>
<p>Among the session's few gainers, Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, the federally owned mining giant, rose 0.86 percent to 18.66 reais.</p>
<p>The bolsa's Electrical Energy Index (IEE) of nine most-liquid power shares followed other shares downward, dropped 1.95 percent to end at 1,547 points.</p>
<p>State-owned power firm Eletrobras's preferred B dropped 1.75 percent to close at 280.00 reais.</p>
