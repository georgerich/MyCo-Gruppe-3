<p>Farm reforms on both sides of the Atlantic are expected to boost production for export and sharpen rivalry between the United States and the European Union, the two main agricultural superpowers, analysts say.</p>
<p>U.S. grain and other farm exports are set to expand under a new seven-year &quot;Freedom to Farm&quot; Act which effectively removed production curbs.</p>
<p>American farmers are likely to plant more wheat and maize which will end up on export markets, according to EU officials.</p>
<p>For its part the EU is preparing reforms involving further cuts in its price support mechanism to prevent costs spiralling after it expands eastwards and takes in large numbers of low-cost farmers from 10 former communist countries.</p>
<p>The reforms, aimed at making EU farmers cope with world price levels, would allow a major growth in exports since, under international trade rules, there are no limits on unsubsidised exports of grain and other agricultural products.</p>
<p>But Brussels would still top up European farmers' incomes through direct payments independent of what they produce.</p>
<p>&quot;(EU) farmers could be receiving world market prices for what they sell and then get a side package of compensatory payments,&quot; said U.S. agricultural attache George Pope.</p>
<p>In an interview on Monday, Pope said that the big battle in the next round of European farm reform was likely to be over the level of compensatory payments for cuts in support prices.</p>
<p>Under the Farm Act signed by President Bill Clinton in April, U.S. farmers also receive fixed aid payments independent of market prices with an extra safety net of a loan rate system.</p>
<p>But the major change is that American farmers no longer have to set aside farmland annually and can choose what crops, except for fruit and vegetables, to grow.</p>
<p>However, the EU, anxious to prevent mountains of unwanted grain reappearing as farmers cash in on record world prices, has maintained a compulsory, annual set-aside but at a lower rate.</p>
<p>We want to keep some control of output, said an EU official.</p>
<p>Most EU farmers will have to set aside five percent of their farmland in 1997, compared with 15 percent when the scheme was introduced in 1993 and public stocks stood at 33 million tonnes.</p>
<p>Pope said around 35 million acres (14 million hectares) of U.S. farmland continued to be set aside under a long-term Conservation Reserve Programme.</p>
<p>U.S. Agricultural Secretary Dan Glickman was surprised that more farmers had not moved out of the long-term programme to take advantage of the new production opportunities, Pope said.</p>
<p>However, the new act was only signed late in the marketing year and farmers may opt out next year, he said.</p>
<p>European farmers have attacked the Farm Act, saying it aimed to increase American dominance of world grain and other agricultural markets. But Pope said U.S. farm exports would be rising in expanding world markets.</p>
