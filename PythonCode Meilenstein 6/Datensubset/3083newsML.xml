<p>A British burglar who decided to try for a quick tan after breaking into a hospital nearly roasted to death on a sunbed, a court heard on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Owen Crowther, 18, suffered third degree burns on 90 percent of his body after just 15 seconds on the sunbed in Salisbury District Hospital in southern England.</p>
<p>After being treated at another local hospital Crowther admitted the burglary.</p>
<p>&quot;He's very lucky not to have killed himself with that machine,&quot; his lawyer Sarah Barnard told the court.</p>
<p>&quot;He was under it for 15 seconds and 45 seconds causes death. He was in extreme pain when he was caught and in great distress.&quot;</p>
<p>Salisbury magistrates, who were told the machine used to treat skin complaints was 60 times more powerful than a regular sunbed, ajourned the case after ordering Owens to undergo psychiatric tests.</p>
