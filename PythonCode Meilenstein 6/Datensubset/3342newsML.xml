<headline>Argentine bonds end slightly lower after slow day.</headline>
<dateline>BUENOS AIRES 1996-08-20</dateline>

<p>Argentine bonds finished slightly lower Tuesday and virtually unchanged from their morning levels.</p>
<p>Traders said there was no news to move the market on the domestic front. And, as largely expected by market players, the U.S. Federal Reserve opted to leave interest rates unchanged giving no new direction to Argentine bonds.</p>
<p>The 5.5 percent dollar-denominated Bocon Previsional 2 due 2001 slipped $0.15 to 114.85. Argentina's FRB due 2005 fell 1/8 to 77-1/4.  </p>
<p>&quot;There was little movement today,&quot; said a trader at a large Argentine brokerage house.</p>
<p>Otherwise, a delegation from the International Monetary Fund arrived in Argentina Tuesday to look into the state of the economy after the IMF-agreed budget deficit target in the first half was overshot by more than $1.0 billion.</p>
<p>Economy Minister Roque Fernandez announced a series of measures including mainly fuel tax hikes with which he hopes to save $1.2 billion this year on the budget deficit. Without the measures, he warned the deficit would be $6.6 billion.  </p>
<p>The Economy Ministry said Fernandez will meet the IMF mission on Friday.</p>
<p>The government said it would send the measures to Congress later Tuesday, although Oscar Lamberto, chairman of the lower house's Budget and Finance Committee said they would not become law until end-September or early October.</p>
<p>Traders said because no major new developments were expected this week, the market might remain flat. &quot;I do not expect much movement this week,&quot; said the trader.</p>
