<title>AUSTRALIA: RTRS-Australian Commodities Roundup - Aug 22.</title>
<headline>RTRS-Australian Commodities Roundup - Aug 22.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1996-08-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>A survey that found slow progress in the U.S. corn (maize) crop supported world benchmark grain prices in the Chicago futures pits on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Commodities Research Bureau Index closed 0.81 points lower at 249.84.</p>
<p>GRAINS</p>
<p>August holidays continued to subdue activity in the commodity markets. Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) soybean and corn futures were both higher early on reports from a U.S. crop tour indicating progress lagging far behind normal in the eastern U.S. corn belt, traders said.</p>
<p>Crop scouts on the ProFarmer tour in Ohio and Indiana said potential corn yields were below last year's tour estimate. They also said the soybean pod count was below the level of a year ago.</p>
<p>Wheat was slightly lower on a technical break but was underpinned by the gains in corn and soybeans plus unsettled weather in U.S. and Canadian spring wheat areas.</p>
<p>Corn was soon 1-3/4 to three cents per bushel higher, with September up three at $3.65-1/4. Wheat was unchanged to 1/2 cent per bushel lower, with September unchanged at $4.54-1/2.</p>
<p>METALS</p>
<p>Light bouts of short-covering and speculative buying aided a bounce in copper prices by Wednesday's London Metal Exchange (LME) close, though prices remained firmly entrenched in recent ranges. Three months delivery rallied from a low of $1,915 to close at $1,936, little moved from Tuesday's LME kerb close of $1,931.</p>
<p>Other metals were also quiet and largely matched the gyrations of the copper contract.</p>
<p>Aluminium held within its $1,480/$1,500 range and was last at $1,490, up $1. Traders said they expected aluminium to consolidate but did not rule out fresh consumer buying in September which could have the potential to move prices higher.</p>
<p>Zinc held lower levels after Tuesday's poor chart close.</p>
<p>It was last at $1,022, against $1,031.</p>
<p>Nickel settled higher at $7,250 on the back of fresh trade and merchant buying. It closed Tuesday at $7,185.</p>
<p>Lead was $4 lower at $820, while tin was down $10 at $6,150.</p>
<p>Alloy was quoted at $1,287/90/, versus $1,280/83.</p>
<p>Silver consolidated at firmer levels after fixing at its highest since June 19, 1996 on Tuesday on buying by speculators.</p>
<p>It fixed at $5.2075 an ounce after $5.2025 on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Gold closed in London at $387.25 after $387.55 on Tuesday in quiet activity.</p>
<p>OIL</p>
<p>World oil prices continued to slide for the second day on Wednesday following the sharp gains posted over the past week.</p>
<p>But storm-related shutdowns of key oil export ports in Mexico kept a floor under prices, traders said.</p>
<p>October futures for world benchmark Brent Blend crude from the North Sea closed at $20.21 a barrel, 26 cents below Tuesday's close but five cents above Wednesday's low.  </p>
