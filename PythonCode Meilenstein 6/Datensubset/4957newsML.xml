<p>Blue-chip stocks fell Wednesday as investors called time out after a three-session winning streak and tobacco shares plunged as a crucial cigarette liability trial neared an end.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 31.44 points at 5,689.82 after gaining 56 points from Friday to Tuesday.</p>
<p>In the broader market, declining issues led advances 1,225 to 1,048 on moderate volume of 348 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>&quot;We had basic profit-taking in stocks,&quot; said Peter Cardillo, director of research of Westfalia Investments.</p>
<p>Analysts said the stock of Philip Morris and other tobacco companies bowed under the weight of mounting industry lawsuits and signs of increased government oversight.</p>
<p>&quot;Philip Morris is accounting for the cloud over the market,&quot; said Alan Ackerman, a market strategist at Fahnestock &amp; Co. Philip Morris tumbled 3-7/8 to 87-5/8, and was off sharply from its 52-week high of 107-38.</p>
<p>Tobacco shares were already under pressure Wednesday by news that Michigan became the 13th state to sue the industry -- a day after Arizona and Kansas filed suit -- and as a key cigarette trial in Indianapolis was nearing an end.</p>
<p>In another development, the White House said President Clinton was expected to say on Friday that he accepts a Food and Drug Administration recommendation that tobacco be regulated as a drug.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems to be one problem after another. It's a negative for Philip Morris and other tobacco stocks but I don't think it'll affect the rest of the market,&quot; said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp.</p>
<p>Ackerman said, &quot;There's no telling how investors will value tobacco stocks from here on in. It's certainly not an area where an investor can jump in.&quot;</p>
<p>Wall Street was still mindful of the stiff selling in tobacco shares in the wake of an Aug. 8 Florida jury ruling against the industry in a suit filed by a smoker.</p>
<p>Among tobacco shares, RJR Nabisco, parent of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, lost 1-1/8 to 25-3/8, smokeless tobacco maker UST Inc fell 7/8 to 30-7/8 and Loews lost 1-1/4 to 76-5/8.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, late buying in technology issues lifted the recently battered Nasdaq Composite index, which closed up 2.17 points to 1,126.84.</p>
<p>International Business Machines rose 1-7/8 to 112-3/8, Intel added 3/4 to 80-1/4 and Cisco Systems added 1-1/4 to 56-1/4.</p>
<p>Analysts said trading was still seasonally slow.</p>
<p>&quot;We're operating in a vacuum. The only thing to stimulate stocks is bonds,&quot; said Larry Wachtel, a Prudential Securities market analyst. &quot;There's not much volume, not many players and not much conviction.&quot;</p>
<p>In the bond market, the Treasury's key 30-year bond lost 15/32 and its yield rose to 6.84 percent from 6.80 percent at Tuesday's close.</p>
<p>Tobacco stocks nonetheless remained a focus, with traders awaiting the outcome of the Indiana court case. The jury is expected to get the case Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;If they win, tobacco stocks will be saved. If not, tobacco stocks will get another whacking,&quot; Wachtel said.</p>
<p>Among individual stocks, Newbridge Networks jumped 11 to 59-3/8 after the maker of networking equipment laid to rest lingering investor fears with a solid first-quarter report.</p>
<p>Jenny Craig slumped 5-7/8 to 11-3/8. The company late Tuesday blamed new weight-loss drugs for recent soft demand for its weight-loss programmes.</p>
<p>Rexene Corp. fell 2-1/4 to 10-1/2 after privately-held Huntsman Corp. said late Tuesday that it was withdrawing its $460 million bid for the chemical firm.</p>
<p>Oracle lost 1-1/8 to 37-7/8. Goldman Sachs downgraded the stock after its recent run-up.</p>
<p>The Standard &amp; Poor's composite index of 500 stocks fell 0.62 to 665.07. The American Stock Exchange index was off 1.61 to 557.68.</p>
<p>The NYSE Composite index of all listed common stocks fell 0.50 to 356.11. The average share was off 5 cents.</p>
<p>The Wilshire Associates Equity Index -- the market value of NYSE, American and Nasdaq issues -- was 6,496.605 down 7.963 or 0.12 percent.</p>
