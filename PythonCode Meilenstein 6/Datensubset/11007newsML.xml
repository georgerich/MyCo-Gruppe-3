<p>Russian Security supremo Alexander Lebed pushed ahead with a ceasefire plan in rebel Chechnya on Friday, but the absence of public approval from President Boris Yeltsin raised questions about Kremlin support for him.</p>
<p>The ambitious reserve general, whose political career could depend on success in Chechnya, said he would meet the president on Friday to discuss a peace plan negotiated in Chechnya on Thursday. But Yeltsin's office said no meeting was planned.</p>
<p>Hours before Lebed struck the deal in Chechnya, Yeltsin criticised him for acting too slowly to end the 20-month war. He has since made no comment on the truce, which began at noon (0800GMT).</p>
<p>Grozny was relatively calm on Friday and both Russian soldiers and Chechen fighters said the ceasefire was holding.</p>
<p>&quot;Preparations are going on now for the withdrawal of units from southern districts of the republic to the Chechen plain,&quot; Interfax quoted the Russian command in Chechnya as saying.</p>
<p>Lebed, a reserve paratroop general appointed by Yeltsin last week to settle the conflict, said he had been given full command of operations there and would meet Yeltsin in the afternoon.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm in command here. I have legitimate authority to fulfil the duties I have been charged with,&quot; Interfax news agency quoted him as saying on his return to Moscow early on Friday.</p>
<p>But Lebed's powers have never been clearly defined in public and the chain of command has been tangled in recent days.</p>
<p>It will take tough words from Yeltsin to convince Russia's military hawks, humiliated by the rebels' seizure of the Chechen capital Grozny this month, they should give Lebed a chance.</p>
<p>The signs are not encouraging so far.</p>
<p>The head of Russia's North Caucasus military district, which includes Chechnya, noted ceasefires have come and gone before.</p>
<p>Yeltsin said of Lebed on Thursday: &quot;He always promised to solve the Chechnya problem if he had power. Now he has power. But unfortunately the results of his work are not yet obvious.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But we will not despair. We will take the issue to the end,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Izvestia newspaper said the criticism raised serious questions and hinted that the president was out of touch.</p>
<p>&quot;Either the president is still demanding the impossible -- the restoration of legal order in Chechnya as it was on August 5,&quot; it said, referring to the day before rebels seized Grozny.</p>
<p>&quot;Or he is judging the activities of his security adviser on the basis of the siuation before Lebed's last trip to Chechnya.&quot;</p>
<p>Both the United States and the European Community have already welcomed the ceasefire agreements.</p>
<p>&quot;We welcome this agreement... We look forward to its implementation by both of the parties and hope it leads eventually to a political settlement to the Chechen crisis,&quot; U.S. State Department spokesman Glyn Davies said.</p>
<p>Lebed, then commander of the 14th Russian Army, made his name as a peacemaker in Moldova's breakaway Dnestr region in 1992. He was named Yeltsin's security adviser as a vote-winning move between the two rounds of the presidential election.</p>
<p>Lebed had captured 15 percent of the first-round vote, taking third place behind Yeltsin and the communist runner-up.</p>
<p>Yeltsin virtually disappeared from sight soon after the first round, prompting speculation that he was ill.</p>
<p>Aides denied all the rumours and press spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky told Izvestia the president was &quot;lively and dynamic&quot; on Thursday after a two-day break.</p>
<p>Komsomolskaya Pravda said Yeltsin had gone fishing and boating and played billiards during his short vacation.</p>
<p>Yeltsin completed his new government line-up late on Thursday, naming Yevgeny Sidorov as minister for culture.</p>
<p>The team includes one communist minister -- Aman Tuleyev, responsible for ties with the Commonwealth of Independent States. &quot;For the first time in the last five years a communist, rather than a former one, has appeared in the Russian government,&quot; Pravda-5 newspaper wrote on Friday.</p>
<p>Both Yeltsin and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin were Communist Party members. Yeltsin quit the party in July 1990, 17 months before the Soviet Union fell apart.</p>
