<p>One of China's propaganda tsars has vowed that boosting the flagging fortunes of Communist Party publications will be his top task next year, the People's Daily said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a solemn political mission ... the most important of important tasks,&quot; the newspaper quoted Xu Guangchun, deputy head of the Communist Party's Propaganda Department, as saying.</p>
<p>Authorities want to boost the circulation of the People's Daily -- the Communist Party mouthpiece -- and Qiushi magazine -- a bi-monthly devoted to political theory -- in government offices, factories and schools, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>The circulation of the People's Daily in Beijing alone has plunged by about 30 percent this year, alarming propaganda officials, a Chinese source said.</p>
<p>The Communist Party controls the mass media, using them as tools of ideological propaganda.</p>
<p>But some newspapers and magazines are less tightly policed than others, and they have made inroads in capturing a market share from the party's main publications.</p>
<p>The People's Daily and Qiushi magazine are a dull read compared to the hundreds of racier, market-oriented publications that have sprung up in recent years.</p>
<p>The People's Daily is still China's leading newspaper, with daily circulation of about two million, due largely to mandatory purchases by state agencies and enterprises.</p>
<p>The newspaper said that in the drive to boost sales, the giving of gifts or &quot;excessive&quot; rebates would not be permitted.</p>
<p>The newspaper industry faces a range of problems, including a surplus of publications, duplication of content and low economic return, said Liang Heng, deputy director of the State Press and Publication Administration of China.</p>
<p>Some papers are losing money and have been forced to merge with lucrative ones, the official Xinhua news agency quoted him as saying.</p>
<p>Nine large newspapers have merged with 12 small newspapers and magazines so far, the agency said.</p>
<p>Liang said mergers, a new trend in China, should be carried out cautiously. Currently, only newspapers run by organisations of the Communist Party are allowed to merge with other publications.</p>
