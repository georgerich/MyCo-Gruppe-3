<p>The space shuttle Atlantis, fitted with new rockets, was shifted to its seaside launch pad on Tuesday, bringing astronaut Shannon Lucid one step closer to home.</p>
<p>Atlantis is being primed for a Sept. 12 launch to pick up Lucid from the Russian Mir space station, where she has been working since March. The 53-year-old mother of three was due home earlier this month, but NASA delayed Atlantis' flight by six weeks to replace two suspect rocket boosters.</p>
<p>The shuttle made the slow, 3.4 mile (5.5 km) journey from its assembly building to the launch pad at the Kennedy Space Centre, riding atop a giant caterpillar-tracked transporter.</p>
<p>Shuttle managers ordered new solid rocket boosters for Atlantis after dangerously hot gas singed crucial seals in the boosters used to launch sistership Columbia in June.</p>
<p>Rocket engineers blamed the problem on a change in the adhesive and cleaning fluid used to assemble the slender 149-foot-long (45-metre) boosters. Atlantis' new set of rocket motors was built using old, tried and tested materials.</p>
<p>NASA is now seeking permission to continue using the old adhesive and cleaning agent, which was supposed to be phased out for environmental reasons.</p>
<p>Atlantis, which will also carry Lucid's replacement to Mir, John Blaha, is now scheduled for launch on Sept. 12, but may still face a further delay because the Air Force has a prior claim to the launch slot that day.</p>
<p>A Delta 2 rocket is scheduled to launch a military navigation satellite from Cape Canaveral on Sept. 12 and will use the same tracking and safety equipment needed by the shuttle.</p>
<p>The Delta launch team is trying to speed up their launch preparations but if they cannot the shuttle will have to wait until Sept. 14.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope the Delta can launch earlier, clearing the way for Atlantis on the 12th,&quot; said NASA spokesman Bill Johnson.</p>
