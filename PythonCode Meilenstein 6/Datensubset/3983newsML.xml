<title>UK: Brazil buying of Europe oil products up in August.</title>
<headline>Brazil buying of Europe oil products up in August.</headline>

<p>Brazilian state oil company Petrobras has ramped up its purchases of gas oil and naphtha in August, and traders said it was because of a combination of surging demand and refinery maintenance programmes.</p>
<p>European traders expect Petrobras to have lifted more than 200,000 tonnes of 0.3-0.5 percent sulphur gas oil from the Mediterranean in August, in addition to its 75,000-tonne term contract with Italian refiner Isab.</p>
<p>This compares with a total 700,000 tonnes of gas oil imports from the Mediterranean over the whole of last year, traders said.</p>
<p>In addition, around 150,000 tonnes of August-loading naphtha is thought to have been sold to Brazil out of Europe. Yearly comparisons were not immediately available, but these quantities were thought to be unusually high.</p>
<p>Traders said maintenance at Brazilian refineries in August, most notably at the 250,000 barrels per day Sao Paulo plant, was the reason for the sudden shortage of naphtha.</p>
<p>Officials at Petrobras in London declined to comment on their purchases or on Brazilian refinery activities.</p>
<p>An Italian refiner, commenting on the gas oil purchases, said: &quot;(Brazil) is experiencing very fast economic growth...The main demand (for gas oil) is coming from the transportation sector.&quot;</p>
<p>Traders reckon demand for imported gas oil could reach 400,000 tonnes a month over the rest of the year, with most of the product sourced from the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems that the Med is the best area to buy from. It works out best in terms of freight rates because we can load big vessels,&quot; the refiner said.</p>
<p>&quot;And it has worked for us since the arb to the Far East is now closed most of the time.&quot;</p>
<p>The only question mark hanging over the fast-growing gas oil trade is the introduction of low sulphur (0.05 percent) diesel as the standard diesel grade across the European Union from October 1.</p>
<p>A wide price differential between grades could make the trade with Brazil uneconomic, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;If the price (for the low sulphur product) is good, we may lose interest in selling the poorer gas oil,&quot; said the refiner.</p>
