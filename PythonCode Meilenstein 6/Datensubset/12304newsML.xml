<p>China on Friday hailed the success of its &quot;Strike Hard&quot; anti-crime campaign, but said the battle was far from over.</p>
<p>&quot;The 'Strike Hard' battle of the last several months has had a huge impact and excellent results,&quot; the Communist Party mouthpiece People's Daily said in a front-page commentary.</p>
<p>The &quot;Strike Hard&quot; campaign was launched in April to restore public confidence in the government amid a rising tide of crime that has aroused widespread popular resentment.</p>
<p>But the success of the highly publicised campaign -- in which more than 160,000 people have been arrested and more than 1,000 executed -- should not be overestimated, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>&quot;In some places, brazen and arrogant criminals have not yet been put down...some fugitives have not yet been apprehended, some gangs have not yet been smashed,&quot; the newspaper said.</p>
<p>Rapid economic growth and changing values stemming from nearly two decades of market reforms had led to a rise in criminal activity, the Xinhua news agency said in a report late on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;The expectation that all (security) problems can be solved by anti-crime campaigns alone is unrealistic,&quot; Xinhua said. &quot;A new social mechanism which can effectively control those problems has not emerged.&quot;</p>
<p>Xinhua said police would try to improve crime prevention and strengthen grassroots crime-fighting efforts.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to mobilize the whole society for the comprehensive management of security and wage a long-term battle against crime,&quot; Xinhua said.</p>
<p>&quot;In short, the task is still quite formidable,&quot; the People's Daily said.</p>
