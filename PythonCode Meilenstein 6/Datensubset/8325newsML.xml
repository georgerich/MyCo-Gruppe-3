<p>The German Bundesbank surprised financial markets on Thursday with a larger than expected cut in its main money market interest rate.</p>
<p>The central bank said after its regular council meeting that it was cutting its securities repurchase rate, or repo, to three percent from 3.30 percent.</p>
<p>Its official discount and Lombard rates -- the floor and ceiling for money market rates -- were held steady at 2.50 and 4.50 percent, respectively, in line with economists' expectations.</p>
<p>The Bundesbank gave no explanation of its decision in an initial statement made after the council meeting.</p>
<p>In Paris, the Bank of France trimmed its key intervention rate to 3.35 percent from 3.55 at a money market tender. Economists had virtually ruled out a cut in French rates but the move was preceded by the reduction in the German repo rate.</p>
<p>Financial markets' attention had been focused on the outcome of the meeting, with many players saying the Bundesbank had to act to avert an outbreak of tension in currency markets.</p>
<p>German bond and share markets rose slightly in response to the news. Other currencies also firmed against the German mark.</p>
<p>Market speculation ahead of the meeting had centred on the Bundesbank's repo rate, which it has held steady since February, despite lowering its official rates in mid-April.</p>
<p>Early this week, a slowdown in German M3 money supply growth to an annualised 8.6 percent in July from 9.6 percent in June convinced markets that the central bank could finally deliver a long-awaited easing in the money market rate this week.</p>
<p>Hopes for an easing had dwindled on Wednesday and Thursday after fresh economic statistics indicated that the economy was in better shape than many had thought, removing one basic argument in favour of easing monetary policy.</p>
<p>A Reuter survey showed seven of 10 economists polled believed Wednesday's news that the Ifo institute business climate index had jumped to an eight-month high of 94.1 in July had decreased the chance for a repo rate cut at the meeting.</p>
<p>A poll of the economists before the Ifo data showed eight of 10 economists expected a rate cut of five to 20 basis points.</p>
<p>Economists were surprised by the size of the move.</p>
<p>Uwe Angenendt at BHF Bank in Frankfurt said: &quot;We had not expected such a large step. This is positive news for the dollar. I see a strengthening of the dollar against the mark on this news.&quot;</p>
<p>He added: &quot;It is difficult to say whether this will be the end of rate cuts in this cycle. We see a strengthening of the economy and, against that background, it could be an end to this cycle. But we have to wait for more data.&quot;</p>
<p>Stefan Schneider, senior economist at Paribas Capital Markets in Frankfurt, said he was also surprised by the move.</p>
<p>&quot;It was quite a big surprise. I believe more and more signs of the German economy recovering has limited the scope of the Bundesbank to keep the interest rate fantasy alive.</p>
<p>&quot;I interpret this cut as the final move in interest rates for this cycle.&quot;</p>
