<p>Russian troops started intensive heavy artillery attacks against rebel positions in the Chechen capital Grozny on Wednesday, setting parts of the city ablaze and sending a column of black smoke into the air.</p>
<p>The attacks started the day before Russian military were widely expected to launch a major assault to drive rebels out of the Chechen capital. Warplanes screamed overhead and a loud blast sounded after one flew over. A plume of black smoke rose from the Zavodskoy district of the city, dotted with factories and oil refineries.</p>
<p>The centre of the city was almost deserted. In the once-bustling market place, a comandeered Russian armoured personnel carrier with a Chechen flag painted on it was tucked between two buildings.</p>
<p>Rebels had also captured a Russian tank and sprayed the slogan &quot;Freedom or Death&quot; on its side. A captured Russian flag hung folornly on top of it.</p>
<p>Russia's acting military commander in Chechnya, Lieutenant- General Konstantin Pulikovsky, had given the separatists 48 hours to withdraw from Grozny or face an all-out bombardment.</p>
<p>His superior, Lieutenant-General Vyacheslav Tikhomirov, backed Pulikovsky on the assault when he returned from leave on Wednesday. Russian media assumes that the deadline expires at midnight (2000 GMT on Wednesday).</p>
<p>Attacks have clearly already begun and I saw several new craters and houses damaged in the centre of Grozny. One single-storey building was on fire and it looked as if it had been burning for a few hours.</p>
<p>The flood of refugees trying to escape the city had slowed to a trickle. I saw only about 100-200 refugees on the road in the course of two hours.</p>
<p>The shelling broke out hours before Russia's security supremo Alexander Lebed, whom President Boris Yeltsin had ordered to restore control over Grozny seized by rebels on August 6, was due to arrive in the region.</p>
<p>Lebed's press office said that the ex-paratroop general would discuss the ulitmatum.</p>
<p>Lebed, who is also secretary of Yeltsin's policy-making Security Council, has made it clear that he opposes the bombing of Grozny, arguing that it could lead to bloodshed in the rebel province and public resentment at home and abroad.</p>
