<headline>Lebed arrives for talks with Chechen rebels.</headline>
<dateline>NOVYE ATAGI 1996-08-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>President Boris Yeltsin's security adviser, Alexander Lebed, began a new round of talks with Chechen separatist leaders on Thursday and promised to try to end the conflict.</p>
<p>&quot;We will today try to stop the war,&quot; he told reporters on arrival at the rebel-held village of Novye Atagi, some 20 km (12 miles) from the Chechen capital Grozny. &quot;We will sort out concrete measures to do that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We have gathered here with the firm intention of achieving something worthwhile. We are going to discuss the issues of how to separate the troops and give Grozny the status of a demilatarised city,&quot; Lebed said.</p>
<p>Lebed, charged by President Boris Yeltsin with the tricky task of resolving the Chechen crisis, said on Wednesday he had agreed a ceasefire with rebel chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov.</p>
<p>He said the Russian military would not carry out a threat to flatten Grozny, held by the separatists since August 6 and described the military ultimatum as a &quot;bad joke&quot;.</p>
<p>Lebed arrived in the village in a convoy of three helicopters, one carrying bodyguards and one with journalists aboard. An aide said the talks were likely to last for about three hours.</p>
