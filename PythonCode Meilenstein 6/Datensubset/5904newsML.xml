<p>President Mohamed Taki of the coup-prone Comoro Islands dissolved the government on Wednesday and asked his outgoing prime minister to form a new cabinet.</p>
<p>Ministers said Taki summoned them at short notice and told them Prime Minister Tadjiddine Ben Said Massonde had tendered his resignation and had been asked to form a new government.</p>
<p>Taki dissolved the 14-member government a week after suspending government and ministerial meetings in preparation for a new cabinet with its members united in one political party.</p>
<p>Earlier this month Taki said he wanted to unite the parties which supported him in presidential polls in March this year.</p>
<p>The government dissolved on Wednesday included candidates he defeated in presidential elections but who were seen as necessary to balance political factions after an abortive coup in September last year.</p>
<p>The Indian Ocean Comoro Islands have seen up to 17 coups or attempted coups since independence from France in 1975.</p>
