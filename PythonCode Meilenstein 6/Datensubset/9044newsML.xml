<p>Rwanda and Zaire said they agreed on Thursday to repatriate 1.1 million Rwandan Hutu refugees who fled to eastern Zaire in three months of civil war and genocide in 1994.</p>
<p>Zairean Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo told a joint news conference with his Rwandan counterpart Pierre Celestin Rwigema the operation would begin with closing all Rwandan refugee camps in Zaire.</p>
<p>&quot;The two heads of government (Kengo and Rwigema) have decided to make operational the organised, massive and unconditional repatriation of all Rwandan refugees,&quot; said a statement read by Kengo.</p>
<p>&quot;This (repatriation) is going to be carried out rapidly. The repatriation will be enormous and immediate. We are at a stage where Zaire is going to proceed with the closure of the camps,&quot; Kengo added.</p>
<p>Zaire has said before that it would close the camps in eastern Zaire but the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) says repatriation must be voluntary.</p>
<p>Kengo, who has repeatedly stressed the need for the Rwandan Hutu refugees in Zaire to return home, visited Rwanda while it was receiving thousands of Rwandan refugees who were leaving its southern neighbour Burundi.</p>
<p>The U.N. refugee agency said it ended on Thursday the repatriation from Burundi of more than 45,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees from the biggest camp in northern Burundi.</p>
<p>Paul Stromberg, spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), told Reuters by telephone from northern Burundi that the last 6,000 refugees were en route to Rwanda from Magara refugee camp, leaving behind only 220 who refused to go.</p>
<p>&quot;The last convoy left with about four trucks. The camp of Magara is now empty except for these 220 people. These people do not want to return home for one reason or another,&quot; Stromberg said.</p>
<p>Asked about what would happen to those who had refused to go back, Stromberg said: &quot;They are still refugees and will be treated as such. One option is to move them to another site and this can be done without government approval.&quot;</p>
<p>He said a total of 6,000 Rwandan Hutus went back home on Thursday and a total of 50,000 refugees from Magara camp would have returned once the last convoy reached south Rwanda.</p>
<p>Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko has intervened in the past two years to stop Kengo from ordering, in violation of international law, the deportation from Zaire of the 1.1 million Rwandan Hutus.</p>
<p>Kengo's visit was the first by such a senior Zairean official since the Tutsi-dominated Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) rebels took power in 1994 and drove into exile in Zaire the Hutu government and Hutu soldiers held reponsible for the genocide.</p>
<p>The civil war in Rwanda and the seizure of power by the RPF led to strained ties between the two neighbouring states.</p>
<p>Last August, Zairean troops forcibly expelled some 15,000 Rwandan and Burundian Hutus. The expulsions were only stopped after Mobutu stepped in following an international outcry.</p>
<p>Together with the refugees, eastern Zaire is also home to Rwanda's 40,000-strong former Hutu army and Hutu militiamen who infiltrate back into Rwanda and are a major security concern for Kigali.</p>
<p>Government officials said Rwanda would also raise with Kengo the issue of the rebels based in Zaire who together with Hutu rebels in Burundi have stepped up their attacks in Rwanda and Burundi this year.</p>
<p>Rwandan officials said they wanted assurances that Zaire would take action against rebels operating from its territory. It was unclear what Kengo's response was.</p>
<p>The rebels have disrupted economic activity in the Rwandan border towns of Cyangugu and Gisenyi, Rwandan officials say. Kengo was due to return to the Zairean capital Kinshasa on Thursday night.</p>
