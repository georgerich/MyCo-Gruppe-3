<p>Indonesian soldiers clashed with kidnappers of 12 forestry workers in remote Irian Jaya on Thursday, killing one of the armed gang in an attempt to free the hostages, official media said.</p>
<p>The Antara news agency said none of the 12 hostages, seized on August 14, was freed and soldiers would continue efforts to free them. One hostage had escaped since authorities first learned of the kidnapping.</p>
<p>The hostages, employees of PT Kamundan Raya, a subsidiary of private forestry concern Djajanti Group, were taken from their base camp, about 60 km (37 miles) west of the town of Timika, by a group of armed Irianese.</p>
<p>Antara quoted Irian Jaya army spokesman, Lieutenant-Colonel Maulud Hidayat, as saying troops seized one gun and two magazines containing 34 bullets in the clash near Dania, an Irian village.</p>
<p>&quot;The gun, seized from the dead member of the security disturbance movement is believed to be one of the three weapons used by its members when they kidnapped the employees of PT Kamundan Raya,&quot; Antara said .</p>
<p>The army in Irian Jaya refers to the kidnappers as members of the security disturbance movement, the same term used to describe the separatist Free Papua Movement (OPM) which aims to free Irian Jaya from Indonesian rule.</p>
<p>On August 18, Antara said the kidnappers were demanding Kamundan Raya cease its logging activities, appoint a tribal leader as a mediator and involve a human rights organisation in negotiations before freeing the workers.</p>
<p>Hidayat said the army used four helicopters and a tracking dog in their attempt to free the hostages and added that the workers should be released soon.</p>
<p>He said the slainn kidnapper's body had been taken to Timika, 4,000 km (2,500 miles) east of Jakarta. Antara gave no further details.</p>
<p>Indonesia faces scattered resistance to its rule in Irian Jaya, a former Dutch colony it took control of in 1963, especially from the OPM.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the OPM held 11 people, including five Europeans, captive for more than four months in what it said was an act aimed at publicising its fight for a free Irian Jaya.</p>
<p>In May, four British, two Dutch and three Indonesian hostages held by the OPM escaped after an army operation for their rescue was launched. Two Indonesian hostages were killed by their captors.</p>
