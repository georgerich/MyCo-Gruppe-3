<p>Kilos of cocaine and packets of marijuana are scattered on tables down the hall from a walk-in closet housing an arsenal with everything from homemade handguns to an anti-tank gun.</p>
<p>The scene is not the nerve centre of a drug trafficking cartel but just the opposite -- the crime lab of the Metro-Dade Police Department.</p>
<p>With Miami ensconced at the top of the FBI's list of most crime-ridden U.S. cities and a leading drug smuggling locale, the 55-member laboratory staff keeps busy with cases that show why southern Florida has been an inspiration for best-selling novels like Carl Hiaasen's &quot;Strip Tease,&quot; made into a movie with Demi Moore this summer, and the hit 1980s television series &quot;Miami Vice.&quot;</p>
<p>Scientists handle thousands of cases every year, analysing blood, bones and body parts, twisted pieces of metal wreckage, drugs, and bullets, guns and other weapons -- a workload as varied as the region itself, a mecca for retirees, tourists and immigrants and a centre for international finance and trade, both legitimate and illegitimate.</p>
<p>There was the innovative middle-aged woman who set up a lab-on-wheels to produce crack cocaine, drying cocaine in a microwave oven in the back of her van. And the teenage drug seller who, after being acquitted on a technicality, asked the judge if he could have his pills back. &quot;He (the judge) just said, 'Get out of here,'&quot; police spokesman Pat Brickman said.</p>
<p>There are new stories like a call to serologists this spring to examine animals allegedly killed by &quot;chupacabras,&quot; the &quot;goat sucker,&quot; a creature said to suck the blood of its animal victims that was reported in Puerto Rico, Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America before its alleged move to Miami.</p>
<p>The crime lab found the &quot;chupacabras&quot; wounds were inflicted by dogs.</p>
<p>Older stories include the forensic dentist on the staff who helped nail Ted Bundy, the notorious serial killer found guilty in 1979 after preying on young women at a University of Florida sorority house.</p>
<p>The weapons analysis section, where the tables of ballistics experts are stacked with small boxes of cartridges, includes a Finnish-made anti-tank gun taller than most men. The shoulder-fired device, which is the largest weapon in the lab's collection, was seized about 20 years ago from a Cuban exile organisation whose members were training to invade their Communist-ruled homeland.</p>
<p>The lab handled about 12,000 drug cases in 1995 -- versus only about 1,000 in the early 1970s -- about 80 percent of them involving cocaine, and 80 percent of the cocaine cases involving crack cocaine.</p>
<p>&quot;We are the gateway to the United States for drugs,&quot; said Robert DiMarys, an analyst who came to Miami from New York, where his assignments included the celebrated French Connection heroin investigation.</p>
<p>Although analysts now use millions of dollars of high-tech equipment unavailable two decades ago, the crime lab's drug caseload in recent years has reached what Supervisor Barry McCabe termed &quot;pure torture.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If it (the case load) spikes up again, I don't know what would happen,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Analysts also handled about 9,000 weapons cases last year.</p>
<p>All of the laboratory's technicians are trained to testify in court. DiMarys spoke matter-of-factly of one experience as he casually handled several packages of cocaine with a street value estimated at some $130,000 each.</p>
<p>&quot;This may look like a lot ... but I once had a case with 208 of these,&quot; he said. But the veteran analyst, standing in his white coat amid the high-tech equipment, noted that even that amount of evidence had not yielded a conviction.</p>
<p>&quot;They threw it (the case) out. The judge didn't like the arrest,&quot; he said.</p>
