<title>JAPAN: Bomb threats to US base in Japan called nuisance.</title>

<p>A United States naval base in Japan received two bomb threats this month, but determined they were nuisance calls, a U.S. Navy spokesman said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;No bombs were found and the calls were evaluated by base security as nuisance calls,&quot; said a spokesman at the Yokosuka Naval Base near Tokyo.</p>
<p>Calls saying a bomb had been placed at a club on the base were received on August 9 and on August 19, prompting the evacuation of the club and the closure of the main gate, he said.</p>
<p>Patrol officers, however, found no bombs on either occasion, the latest of 10 such calls this year, he said.</p>
<p>Anti-base sentiment among Japanese has increased since the rape last year of a schoolgirl on the southern island of Okinawa by three U.S. servicemen stationed there.</p>
<p>The anti-base movement, however, has not resorted to violence, instead forming a high-profile political campaign to force Japanese and U.S. authorities to trim the bases.</p>
