<p>Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto departed on Tuesday for a five-nation Latin American visit, saying he was &quot;relieved&quot; at the release of a kidnapped Japanese executive in Mexico, his first stop.</p>
<p>&quot;I was truly relieved to hear the news,&quot; Hashimoto said of the release of Japanese electronics executive Mamoru Konno, in the Mexican-U.S. border city of Tijuana after a $2 million ransom was paid.</p>
<p>After nine days in captivity, Konno, president of a U.S. subsidiary of Japan's Sanyo Electric Co was found in the basement of an unoccupied building after a Mexican police official contacted kidnappers with the money.</p>
<p>Hashimoto, who expressed gratitude to Mexican authorities and confidence in their ability to deal with any future problems, stressed that he believed Japanese firms &quot;would not pull out or scale down operations in Mexico&quot;.</p>
<p>Hashimoto's 10-day tour of Mexico, Chile, Brazil, Peru and Costa Rica will be the first by a Japanese prime minister for seven years to a region whose economic growth is second only to East Asia.</p>
<p>Tokyo has pumped nearly $60 billion into the region in the past 14 years as direct investment, and its economic aid in 1995, at $1.14 billion, was double the level of 1990.</p>
<p>While Japan is the second-largest trading partner after the United States with Latin America, only about four percent of Tokyo's total exports make it to the region.</p>
<p>Japanese officials said Hashimoto hoped to lay a basis for more investment in Latin America, greater exports and closer political ties.</p>
<p>Hashimoto is slated to make a rest stop in Hawaii before returning to Japan on August 30.</p>
