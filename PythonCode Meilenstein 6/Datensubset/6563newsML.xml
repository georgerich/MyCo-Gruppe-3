<p>Shares across Indian bourses rebounded for the second successive day as foreign funds joined local investment institutions on Wednesday in bargain hunting, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Fund managers turned bargain hunters as valuations looked attractive,&quot; one broker said referring to the recent slide in blue-chip shares.</p>
<p>The 30-share BSE index jumped 90.16 points, or 2.72 percent, to 3,406.22.</p>
<p>The Delhi index rose 21.88 points, or 2.8 percent, to 795.74.  </p>
<p>Delhi brokers said expectations that Finance Minister P. Chidambaram might reconsider the 12.9 percent minimum tax on companies was one factor that pushed the market.</p>
<p>The tax was proposed in last month's budget which will be passed by parliament next month.</p>
<p>The 500-stock CRISIL firmed 13.82 points, or 2.07 percent, to 680.27. The 200-share midcap index gained 4.27 points, or 0.91 percent, to 475.84.</p>
<p>Bombay traders said the decision on Tuesday by U.S. Federal Reserve to keep interest rates unchanged was a &quot;morale booster.&quot; Some Japanese and Hongkong-based funds were hectic buyers.  </p>
<p>Foreign funds favoured power and heavy engineering stocks, the traders said. Tata Power firmed 8.25 rupees to 153 and BSES 7.0 to 187.50 while L&amp;T rose 5.75 to 247.50.</p>
<p>Unit Trust of India, the country's biggest investment institution, was a keen buyer, the traders said.</p>
<p>TELCO rallied 18 rupees to 483, Reliance 14.75 to 215.75, ACC rose 128 rupees to 2,152.50, HDFC 30.75 to 2,657.75, Asian Paints 11.75 to 365.75, Grasim 13.25 to 429.25, SBI 6.75 to 273, TISCO 9.25 to 193, ICICI 6.75 to 76.50 and ITC 5.50 to 291.50.</p>
<p>The Calcutta index gained 8.83 points to 450.36 and the Madras index 41.53 to 3,570.44.</p>
