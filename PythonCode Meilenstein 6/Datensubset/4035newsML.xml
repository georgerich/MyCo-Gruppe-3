<p>Suspected Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) rebels have killed three civilians in an attack in central Turkey, police said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Assailants opened fire on two cars on a lonely road in the central province of Sivas on Monday night, killing two women and a two-year-old child, a police official said.</p>
<p>&quot;According to the information we have it was most probably the PKK,&quot; he told Reuters by telephone from Sivas. A local journalist confirmed the attack.</p>
<p>The guerrillas killed a policeman and another person in an attack on an intercity bus in the same area last week. Sivas has only a small Kurdish population and is not one of the ten southeastern provinces under emergency rule where the rebels are most active.</p>
<p>But rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan warned last week that his forces would stage attacks on the periphery of the mainly Kurdish southeast to stretch security forces.</p>
<p>More than 3,000 people have been killed in 12 years of conflict between soldiers the rebels, fighting for autonomy or independence.</p>
<p>The rebels damaged two government buildings in the town of Baskale, near the Iranian border, in a rocket attack on Monday night, Anatolian news agency said. No-one was injured.</p>
