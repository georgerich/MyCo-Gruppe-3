<title>RUSSIA: Who's who in confusing Chechnya command chain?.</title>
<headline>Who's who in confusing Chechnya command chain?.</headline>
<dateline>MOSCOW 1996-08-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>As Russia swung this week between peace talks with Chechen separatists and all-out bombardment of their capital, Grozny, contradictory policy statements raised doubts about the chain of command.</p>
<p>It is as unclear in theory as it is in practice:</p>
<p>President Boris Yeltsin:</p>
<p>The president, newly re-elected for a four-year term on July 3, is commander-in-chief of the Russian armed forces, Europe's biggest and including one of the world's main nuclear arsenals.</p>
<p>He has huge constitutional powers but, after ordering troops into Chechnya in December 1994 to halt its secession, has left day-to-day control of operations to others. His absence from view and rumours of ill-health have fuelled speculation about who conducts policy.</p>
<p>Many Russian analysts believe Yeltsin is still in command but keeps a low profile to avoid blame for the debacle. He may let his subordinates pursue different approaches -- war and negotiations -- to see which is more successful at limiting damage and saving face. Some even say the apparent contradiction is planned to wear down the rebels and divide their leadership.</p>
<p>General Alexander Lebed:</p>
<p>Hired by Yeltsin in June after coming from nowhere to finish third in the first round of the election, the two-star reserve general has amassed three titles, each answerable only to the president: National Security Adviser, Secretary of the Security Council -- chaired by Yeltsin and including defence and interior ministers -- and Yeltsin's personal envoy to Chechnya.</p>
<p>Last week, Yeltsin took political responsibility for settling the crisis away from a State Committee of Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's and gave it to the Security Council. He put Lebed, 46, in charge of ending the war, decreeing him new powers. These have not been publicly spelled out.</p>
<p>The Security Council exposed Kremlin in-fighting when it said on Tuesday officials might be issuing bellicose orders on Chechnya under Yeltsin's name without his knowledge.</p>
<p>Lebed himself, after overruling generals who threatened to bomb Grozny, said of power: &quot;You simply have to take it, as I am quietly doing. We have to restore a single command structure.&quot;</p>
<p>The coming days may tell if the conciliatory ex-paratrooper, whose name means &quot;swan&quot;, can prevail. If he cannot save Moscow's face and end the bloodshed his days in the Kremlin are numbered.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin:</p>
<p>Constitutionally Yeltsin's number two if the president were taken ill, the 58-year-old technocrat was re-appointed this month. Since his State Committee lost its mandate last week, he has taken a back seat in Chechnya. The defence and interior ministers, whose troops are fighting in Chechnya, report to the president, not to the head of the government. Chernomyrdin is reported to see Lebed, who has no cabinet role, as a rival.</p>
<p>Defence Minister Igor Rodionov:</p>
<p>A three-star general and old Lebed ally, Rodionov was plucked from a military academy to head the defence ministry last month, putting him in overall command of some 20,000 troops in Chechnya. It took him two days to publicly disown the local acting commander's threat to start bombing Grozny.</p>
<p>Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov:</p>
<p>Also a general, he commands a further 20,000 troops and police in Chechnya. In spring 1995, the Chechen crisis was classified as an internal security matter under the overall control of the interior ministry. Relations between interior and defence troops are strained. Like Rodionov, Kulikov reports directly to Yeltsin. The president has ignored Lebed's demand, made on Friday, to sack Kulikov for bungling in Grozny.</p>
<p>Lieutenant-General Vyacheslav Tikhomirov:</p>
<p>Appointed by Yeltsin as Commander of the Joint Group of the Federal Forces in Chechnya at the start of the year, he has operational control over all defence and interior troops in the region. A defence ministry officer, Tikhomirov took the war to the rebels in a spring offensive. His manner belies his name, which is derived from the Russian words for &quot;peace&quot; and &quot;quiet&quot;.</p>
<p>Lieutenant-General Konstantin Pulikovsky:</p>
<p>Also a defence ministry officer and Tikhomirov's deputy, he was acting commander for several weeks until Wednesday, when his chief returned from holiday. The rebels humiliated the military by seizing Grozny on his watch and it was Pulikovsky who gave civilians 48 hours to flee or be bombed. Rodionov later said he acted out of turn and had been &quot;given a dressing down&quot;.</p>
