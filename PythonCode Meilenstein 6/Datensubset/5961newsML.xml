<headline>Command over Chechnya operation remains unclear.</headline>

<p>For the 20 months since President Boris Yeltsin sent troops to crush Chechnya's bid to secede from Russia, the question of who is in charge of the crisis has been unclear.</p>
<p>Confusion over Moscow's biggest military operation since the Afghan war was illustrated again on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Just hours before a deadline set by the commander of Russian forces in Chechnya for an all-out bombardment of its capital Grozny, Defence Minister Igor Rodionov disowned the plan.</p>
<p>As Rodionov spoke, his mentor in the Kremlin, security chief Alexander Lebed, was heading for talks with Chechen rebel leaders -- and Russian warplanes had already started bombing.</p>
<p>In late 1994, then-defence minister Pavel Grachev, a strong advocate of the use of force against the rebels, told Yeltsin he needed two hours and a regiment of paratroopers to crush them.</p>
<p>But Russia, faced with resolute guerrillas defending their own mountainous land, needed six months and many more regiments to take control of the bulk of Chechnya -- a region of about a million people and half the size of Belgium.</p>
<p>The army, under Grachev's defence ministry, dominated the initial stages of the operation launched on December 11, 1994. However, heavy losses and heavy going subdued Grachev's optimism.</p>
<p>Once his forces had captured the ruins of Grozny in April he declared the &quot;military stage&quot; of the operation over and said his colleague, then-interior minister Viktor Yerin, would take charge of stamping out remaining pockets of resistance.</p>
<p>From that point on, the rival ministries, defence and interior, have had to struggle to coordinate their actions -- which many observers see as a factor in Russian setbacks in Chechnya.</p>
<p>When the separatists took Grozny back on August 6, interior ministry officials complained that the army refused to help them. Defence ministry officials were quoted as saying their forces in Chechnya had been told not to interfere until they received a written request from the interior ministry.</p>
<p>There are no published official figures on troop numbers in the region. Pavel Felgenhauer, military analyst for the newspaper Sevodnya, has estimated there are around 20,000 interior ministry troops, including police, and 19,000 defence ministry troops.</p>
<p>Both ministries' forces have heavy artillery, armoured vehicles and helicopter gunships. The defence ministry also has combat aircraft.</p>
<p>Against them, the rebels say, is a guerrilla force of less than 10,000.</p>
<p>Theoretically both sets of Russian troops report to the commander of the Joint Group of the Federal Forces in Chechnya, a position now occupied by Lieutenant-General Vyacheslav Tikhomirov. He returned from holiday on Wednesday and appeared to approve of the ultimatum his deputy had issued on Monday.</p>
<p>There are no rules on whom the commander of the Joint Group, nominated directly by the president, reports to.</p>
<p>&quot;He receives a few orders from the defence minister, a few orders from the interior minister, a few orders from Yeltsin and is free to choose which ones to carry out,&quot; a military expert in the region, who asked not to be named, told Reuters.</p>
<p>In theory Yeltsin, who is supreme commander of the Russian armed forces, is in overall charge. But the 65-year-old president has never claimed day-to-day control and policy has swung back and forth between peace talks and main force.</p>
<p>After the rebel attack on Grozny, Yeltsin, out of the public eye for weeks and perhaps keen to be seen resolving the chain of command, gave his new security supremo Alexander Lebed sweeping powers to end the crisis.</p>
<p>Quite how this is supposed to work remains unclear.</p>
<p>The defence and interior ministers report directly to Yeltsin, not to Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.</p>
<p>Lebed is secretary to the Security Council, a non-government body chaired by Yeltsin and including the defence and interior ministers. But his formal powers have not been publicly defined.</p>
<p>Yeltsin issued a decree last week saying the Security Council would coordinate all operations in Chechnya. Yet days later, the president ignored a demand by Lebed that Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov be sacked for the bungling over the conflict.</p>
