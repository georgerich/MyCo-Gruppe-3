<p>Significant extra signals of sustained downward pressure on inflation will be needed if the Bank of Finland is to further ease monetary policy, management board member and director Matti Vanhala said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;I think this is such a sharp move that quite a lot more will be needed for us to be able to consider something further,&quot; he told Reuters by telephone after the bank sliced 25 basis points off its key tender rate, to 3.25 percent.  </p>
<p>In an earlier statement, the central bank said &quot;confirmed reports that inflation should remain subdued&quot; justified the cut.</p>
<p>Vanhala said the timespan for Finland's current moderate inflation outlook stretched up to two years ahead.</p>
<p>&quot;On such a horizon we cannot claim that the risks would have increased that (inflation) would head in the wrong direction, rather the contrary,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Data coming in has confirmed our view that inflation can remain permanently on a lower level, perhaps be a bit lower than we thought,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In its most recent detailed inflation outlook, the central bank on March 13 said inflation would stabilise between 1.5 and two percent.</p>
<p>&quot;My personal view ... is that this opinion is correct and if anything we are perhaps better inside those limits than one would have dared claim earlier,&quot; Vanhala said, adding that he was referring to a couple of months past.</p>
<p>The tender rate was cut by 25 basis points in two steps in June and July to 3.50 percent.  </p>
<p>He insisted Friday's easing was based on careful analysis and would have gone ahead irrespective of Thursday's German Bundesbank repo rate cut to 3.00 percent from 3.30 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;It (the German rate cut) did, of course, not make our decision more difficult ... the operating environment became easier, but our cut would have come in any case,&quot; Vanhala said.</p>
<p>Asked about some observers' views that Finland was ahead of many other European countries in the growth cycle and might have to be the first to raise interest rates to prevent overheating, Vanhala said: &quot;I would not dare to claim that we could be expecting some remarkable upturn.&quot;  </p>
<p>No strong expansion was in sight, he said. The central bank's 1996 growth forecast of slightly below three percent had not been revised, he added.</p>
<p>&quot;There are signs of somewhat more confidence in the domestic economy ... of a certain stimulation in demand,&quot; Vanhala said.</p>
<p>Measured as year-on-year growth, private consumption and investment had been robust already in 1995 -- domestic demand grew 3.7 percent -- but no signs indicated that a strong home market-led recovery was under way, he said.</p>
