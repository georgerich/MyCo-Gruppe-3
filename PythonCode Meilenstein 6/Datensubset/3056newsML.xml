<p>European Union leaders charting the way forward for the bloc are likely to agree to the catch-all concept of &quot;flexibility&quot;, a leading British think-tank warned on Wednesday.</p>
<p>But a general enabling clause is not likely to be accepted in inter-governmental conference (IGC) negotiations. Instead, &quot;flexibility&quot; is likely to be incorporated in the EU treaty on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>The main reason is that the term means different things to the EU's political leaders.</p>
<p>&quot;In the initial stages of the inter-governmental conference &quot;flexibility&quot; has appeared as the big idea in the discussions,&quot; Frank Vibert, director of the European Policy Forum, wrote in a pamphlet.</p>
<p>But he said the terms masked a division between member states wanting a looser Europe and those believing flexibility would enable an inner core of countries to pioneer new ways of extending the powers of  Community institutions.</p>
<p>Vibert noted that French President Jacques Chirac, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and British Prime Minister John Major all support &quot;flexibility&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Each means something different,&quot; he wrote.</p>
<p>Major has claimed credit in Britain for negotiating the country's right to opt out of two key EU policies -- the &quot;Social Chapter' which is designed to lay down basic employment rights, and the planned single currency.</p>
<p>France and Germany are members of the so-called Schengen group linking 10 of the EU's member states which is designed to promote freedom of movement by abolishing border controls.</p>
<p>However, said Vibert, the two countries disagree over control of the EU, with Germany seeing the European Commission developing into a government of Europe but France wanting power to remain with the Council of Ministers.</p>
<p>&quot;The limitation of concepts such as flexibility...is that they may lead to agreements between governments which are simply viewed as fudge,&quot; Vibert said.</p>
<p>He said parliaments and public opinion might not accept political fudges on matters of great importance to them. &quot;It is an illusion to think that great differences about the shape of European political union can be contained for much longer.&quot;</p>
<p>Vibert said flexibility might be used to allow certain member states to cooperate in new areas, for instance the tackling of crime.</p>
<p>But in each instance, hard questions must be faced about about whether EU finance should be committed and whether the bloc's institutions should become involved.</p>
<p>Copies of the report -- &quot;Structured Flexibility in the European Union&quot; -- are available from the European Policy Forum, 20 Queen Ann's Gate, London SW1A 9AA, England. Tel: +44 171 222-0733. The report costs 12 British pounds.</p>
