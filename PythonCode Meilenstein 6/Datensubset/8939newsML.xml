<p>European stocks bounded higher on Thursday after Germany surprised markets with a greater than expected cut in its main money market rate that triggered a series of similar falls among its trading partners.</p>
<p>British stocks jumped to a record close after the Bundesbank sliced 0.3 of a percentage point off its securities repurchase rate, or repo, to an historic low of 3.0 percent.</p>
<p>London's bluechip FTSE 100 index ended 19 points higher at 3,891.1 and bourses across Europe were buoyed as rate cuts emerged in swift succession.</p>
<p>&quot;Forget about the 3,900 level now,&quot; said one senior London dealer. &quot;We're heading for 4,000.&quot;</p>
<p>The Bank of France quickly followed the German lead by lowering its intervention rate to 3.35 percent from 3.55. Belgium, the Netherlands and Austria then acted to trim their rates too.</p>
<p>Equity markets, which had traded cautiously through the morning as the German central bankers met, rose immediately after the Frankfurt news as investors cheered the cut as a positive move for stocks.</p>
<p>The dollar reacted by rising rapidly through 1.49 marks, while the German currency slipped against other European units.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a clear signal by the Bundesbank that it wants a weaker deutschemark -- today's easing is much larger than anticipated,&quot; said Nick Stamenkovic, economist at DKB International in London.</p>
<p>The dollar later drifted down from its highs and by 1600 GMT was trading at 1.4917 marks and 108.26 yen, largely unchanged from 1.4817 marks and 108.34 yen at the close on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Bundesbank cut was bigger than expected by the markets, but central bank president Hans Tietmeyer said a slowdown in German money supply growth and low inflation had allowed the short-term rate to be shaved.</p>
<p>&quot;Now we intend to watch and await further developments for some time. We believe that we have created clarity for the time being...The Bundesbank doesn't follow a short-term policy but follows a steady policy,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>M3 monetary data early this week raised hopes of a repo cut, but prospects had waned before the Bundesbank met after a business climate index released on Wednesday indicated the economy was in better shape than many had thought.</p>
<p>German shares, which had stalled a few points adrift before the rates news, climbed back into positive territory with the DAX index closing floor trade 13.52 points higher at 2,557.26. In later screen-based trade, the IBIS DAX index was nearly 25 points up at 2,559.42.</p>
<p>Dealers had been expecting either no change or a much smaller cut in the repo rate, the Bundesbank's main tool for guiding money market rates.</p>
<p>&quot;It's hard to know what to make of it really. There are two points of view -- that it's all over, that expectations of another interest cut are gone, that the interest rate cycle is complete, or that there is more room for further cuts,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>The Paris bourse closed with sharp gains, cheered by the French rate cut that followed the Bundesbank's move.</p>
<p>&quot;The Bundesbank has once again taken the markets by surprise because since yesterday nobody was still expecting a cut,&quot; said Jacques-Antoine Bretteil, a director at brokers Leven.</p>
<p>The blue-chip CAC-40 index closed up 17.12 points or 0.86 percent at 2,017.76, after hitting a day-high of 2,026.54.</p>
