<p>Huge explosions rocked the Chechen capital on Wednesday after warplanes flew over the city, in what appeared to be the start of large-scale Russian bombing raids.</p>
<p>Reuter correspondent Lawrence Sheets, in Alkhan-Yurt a few km (miles) southwest of Grozny, said the latest explosions were so loud they could only have come from aerial bombs.  </p>
<p>Planes had been screaming over the city on and off since 11 a.m. (0700 GMT), but it had been difficult to tell if periodic blasts came from the air or from heavy artillery fire.</p>
<p>The latest explosions sounded after a plane flew over at around four p.m. (1200 GMT). Another plane followed at a higher altitude a few minutes later.</p>
<p>Officials from the Interior Ministry were not immediately available for comment on whether this marked the start of the all-out bombardment threatened by top military officials.</p>
<p>On Monday, deputy Russian commander Lieutenant-General Konstantin Pulikovsky gave the rebels 48 hours to withdraw from the city. Civilians flooded out, but the separatists, who captured Grozny on August 6, have pledged to fight to the death.</p>
