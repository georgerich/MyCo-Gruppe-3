<p>A fire gutted a hotel in central France early on Wednesday, killing four people and injuring 14 others, officials said.</p>
<p>Flames spread rapidly up a lift shaft in the small and cheap Le Savoy hotel in Clermont-Ferrand, trapping many guests in their rooms on the upper floors.</p>
<p>The cause of the fire, which began around 2 a.m. (midnight GMT), was unknown. The victims were mostly students or workers, all apparently French citizens. Two of those injured were in a serious condition.</p>
<p>Police said the blaze spread upwards from the ground floor and rescuers took more than an hour to bring it under control.</p>
<p>Five people were evacuated via the fire brigade's ladders and seven others battled their way down the stairs and through the flames.</p>
<p>One fireman said the hotel had no emergency exit and there was no night porter.</p>
