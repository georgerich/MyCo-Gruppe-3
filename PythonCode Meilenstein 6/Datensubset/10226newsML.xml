<title>UK: London precious metals stagnant in summer lull.</title>

<p>Precious metals prices hovered near the top of recent ranges on Friday but summer lethargy should prevent them breaking higher in the near term, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Gold's been in a narrow range and I don't think anyone sees it moving up in the next few days,&quot; one dealer said, adding that Monday's market holiday in Britain and Hong Kong would also slow trading.</p>
<p>Gold bullion closed at $387.50 an ounce, compared to $386.95 on Thursday. Some analysts predicted that if support at $386 held, gold could test the $388 and $390 levels next week.</p>
<p>Gold and silver popped a little higher on Thursday afternoon in a burst of buying by investment funds in New York. But neither metal made much progress and quickly came off highs.</p>
<p>Their rise followed the German Bundesbank's cut in a key money market rate. Some analysts said an easier global monetary policy might eventually encourage demand for precious metals.</p>
<p>But most dealers agreed that, at least immediately, gold had ignored the rate cut. &quot;I don't think it's had any effect on the precious metals,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>Gold was also unruffled by strong U.S. July durable goods data on Friday which jolted bond and share markets.</p>
<p>Silver finished steady at $5.23 an ounce, unchanged from Thursday's London close.</p>
<p>Like gold, it was expected to remain range-bound after failing to conquer key resistance at $5.25 on Thursday.</p>
<p>But silver's rally at the start of the week, which took it well above previous resistance around $5.15, was keeping the market slightly on edge.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is a little nervous,&quot; a dealer said. &quot;It's high enough to have to come back. There's a slimmer chance of it going up but if we break through $5.27, we'll see $5.35.&quot;</p>
<p>Platinum closed a touch firmer at $399.50, while its sister metal palladium firmed by $1.25 to $125.00.</p>
