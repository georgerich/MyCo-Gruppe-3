<p>Paramount Pictures is going ahead with a sequel to the Tom Cruise blockbuster, &quot;Mission: Impossible&quot; and hopes to release it in the summer of 1998, Daily Variety reported in its Friday edition.</p>
<p>The big-screen version of the spy TV series has grossed $175 million domestically since opening May 22, and $338 million overseas so far.</p>
<p>It's the biggest success for Viacom Inc-owned Paramount since 1994's &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;. However, many critics complained its plot was incomprehensible.</p>
<p>Cruise will reprise his roles as star and co-producer, and will soon meet Academy Award-winning screenwriter William Goldman, who will write the script, the report said.</p>
<p>It said &quot;Mission: Impossible&quot; director Brian De Palma would have first crack at the sequel, though no deals have been made yet.</p>
<p>Goldman, whose Oscars were for &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot; and &quot;All the President's Men&quot;, earlier this summer criticised some of the season's blockbusters. However, he singled out &quot;Mission: Impossible&quot; as an especially entertaining movie, Daily Variety said.</p>
