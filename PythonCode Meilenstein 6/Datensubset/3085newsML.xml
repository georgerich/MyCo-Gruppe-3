<headline>UK grain futures higher on demand, slow harvest.</headline>

<p>UK grains futures closed higher on Tuesday as rain in some parts of the country slowed the harvest again and on talk of demand from North Africa.</p>
<p>Traders said sellers had also pulled out of the market, adding to firmer tone.</p>
<p>Prices were underpined by reports that some North African countries may be avoiding buying U.S. soft red wheat because the vomitoxin content is exceeding locally permitted levels.</p>
<p>&quot;This could be a chance to get back some of the market we lost to the U.S. last season, if Brussels will let us export,&quot; said a trader.</p>
<p>Rain in some parts of the UK has again slowed the harvest.</p>
<p>&quot;The rain means that the grain isn't coming in as fast as expected and the slower it comes in the more time people have to find storage space which is taking some of the downward pressure off prices,&quot; said another trader.</p>
<p>Wheat futures closed 1.85 to 1.05 stg up on a turnover of 542 lots.</p>
<p>Barley finished 1.65 to 1.35 stg up after trading 79 lots.</p>
<p>In Amsterdam milling wheat futures remained under harvest pressure with values two to five marks lower at the close on a turnover of 24 lots.</p>
<p>Trading on the UK cash markets slowed as the futures rose.</p>
<p>However, feed wheat fetched 106.50 and 107 stg a tonne for Aug on the fob market ex-east coast ports.</p>
<p>On the delivered market most of the trade was for spot material but at lower tonnages than on Monday.</p>
<p>Feed wheat was fetching around 104 stg in East Anglia for spot while milling wheat in the Avon range was trading at 124 stg for Aug and feed barley 106.50 stg for Oct/Dec in East Anglia.</p>
