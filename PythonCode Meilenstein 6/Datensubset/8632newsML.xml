<title>POLAND: POLISH RULING COALITION PARTIES IN TALKS ON POSTS.</title>

<p>The Peasant party in Poland's ruling coalition has agreed not to unilaterally force a total cabinet reshuffle during a coming reform of ministries, a leader of the larger ex-communist grouping said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Chiefs of the two left-leaning parties met late on Wednesday to discuss the impending gradual reorganisation of economic and administrative ministries, and agreed to resume their talks next week.</p>
<p>The reform, scrapping seven ministries and creating several new ones, has renewed tension in the often-uneasy coalition of the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) and the Polish Peasant Party (PSL), in power since 1993.</p>
<p>The Peasants, who want a strong position especially in economic ministries, say the changes should be accompanied by dismissal of the current cabinet and appointment of a new one.</p>
<p>The head of the SLD organisation in parliament, Jerzy Szmajdzinski, said after the talks that the Peasants had agreed not to bring about a so-called constructive vote of no-confidence, a parliamentary procedure which would force a total cabinet reshuffle, without his party's assent.</p>
<p>&quot;One thing was said -- that without our agreement such a constructive vote will not be submitted,&quot; he said on private Radio Zet.</p>
<p>&quot;This was a view clearly stated by our colleagues in the PSL -- that only if we agree can such a move be carried out, and we see no need...&quot; he added.</p>
<p>He said that specific appointments to ministries had not been discussed during Wednesday's talks.</p>
<p>The Peasant party's parliamentary speaker Jozef Zych has said rifts over the cabinet reshuffle could cause a break-up of the coalition and bring about early general elections, otherwise not scheduled until September next year.</p>
<p>SLD Prime Minister Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz, whose position will be strengthened by the reform, aims to replace ministers gradually as of October when the restructuring begins.</p>
<p>The strongest argument is expected to concern the two new powerful ministries of the economy and of the treasury as well as the finance ministry, now headed by Deputy Prime Minister Gregorz Kolodko, which will have a diminished role.</p>
<p>Two new posts, the head of the Treasury ministry and the secretary of a committee on European integration, must be filled by the start of October. -- Anthony Barker +48 22 653 9700</p>
