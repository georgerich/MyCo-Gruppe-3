<p>Chechen rebel chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov appealed on Tuesday to Russian security supremo Alexander Lebed to prevent federal troops from using force to clear separatist fighters from the capital Grozny.</p>
<p>Interfax news agency quoted Maskhadov as saying that Lebed, President Boris Yeltsin's special envoy in Chechnya, should &quot;use all of his influence to stop the approaching madness&quot;.  </p>
<p>Russia's acting commander in Chechnya, General Konstantin Pulikovsky, vowed on Tuesday to use aircraft and heavy artillery to retake Grozny, much of which was seized by rebels on August 6.</p>
<p>But Lebed, who is locked in a power struggle with the interior ministry over the handling of the 20-month-old conflict, has advocated talks with the separatists and opposed aerial bombardment, which he believes could spread the fighting.</p>
<p>Maskhadov said the Chechen side reacted &quot;very calmly&quot; to Pulikovsky's warning to Grozny residents that they should abandon the city by Thursday or risk being caught up in an all-out Russian counter-offensive.</p>
<p>&quot;Implementation of the threat by commander Pulikovsky will not bring glory to Russian weapons, but will only make the situation even worse, driving it into a dead end,&quot; Interfax quoted him as saying.</p>
