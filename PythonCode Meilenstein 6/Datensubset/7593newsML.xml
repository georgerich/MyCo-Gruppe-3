<title>UK: German rate cut seen helping commodity markets.</title>
<headline>German rate cut seen helping commodity markets.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-08-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>A reduction in a key German interest rate by the Bundesbank did little to move commodity prices on Thursday but it could help revive them in the third quarter, econmomists said.</p>
<p>Gold, the most closely related of the commodity markets, shrugged off the move in a very quiet trading day and the other markets were mainly involved in squaring their books ahead of a three-day holiday weekend in Britain and Hong Kong.</p>
<p>But a New York based economist noted the more accommodating monetary policy in Europe could stimulate industry and therefore demand for metals.</p>
<p>Others also noted that the U.S. Federal Reserve (central bank) was likely to leave rates unchanged until after the presidential electionin November having left them unchanged after a policy committee meeting this week</p>
<p>Gold closed a little easier at $386.95 per ounce after blipping a little higher midafternoon when the investment funds took a brief punt at the silver market.</p>
<p>Silver had rallied briskly in New York on Monday also turned back in its latest move when speculators saw a profit-taking opportunity at $5.25 an ounce -- also its peak on Monday.</p>
<p>It closed at $5.23, up three cents from Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;It's going to be $5.15-$5.25. That's it,&quot; one dealer said. But others said it still had momentum from the earlier rally to break higher and test resistance around $5.30.</p>
<p>The industrial metals on the London Metal Exchange had a quiet day with the flagship copper contract trading in a narrow range as it continued to float between $1,900 and $1,970.</p>
<p>Agricultural commodities were mixed with the grains taking direction from generally lower prices on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) futures markets.</p>
<p>CBOT soybean futures were mixed at midsession on bearish input from a crop tour of Illinois, a key U.S. soy producing state, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Results from the crop tour and the weather are good,&quot; a trader said referring to the rationale behind the slide in soybean futures.</p>
<p>Overall good crop weather in the U.S. Midwest also pressured the market.</p>
<p>At 1128 CDT, soybeans were 3-3/4 cents per bushel lower to 2-3/4 higher, with September up 2-3/4 at $8.03.</p>
<p>Wheat futures were lower on improving weather prospects and slow exports of U.S. wheat. &quot;The demand is just not there,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>Wheat was 1/2 to two cents per bushel lower, with September down 1-1/2 at $4.49-1/2.</p>
<p>London cocoa traded in modest volume to end down 18 stg at 1,031 stg but coffee reversed direction on fund-led arbitrage buying to gain $16 on its November contract to end at $1,695.</p>
<p>Sugar remained weak in light trade as a lacklustre New York market failed to inspire sentiment.</p>
