<p>A northern Italian amateur soccer club has urged prison authorities to release a Moroccan midfielder on match days so he can play for them.</p>
<p>Dario Zearo, president of Tolmezzo soccer club, said on Wednesday he wanted to sign 28-year-old Abdul Hajim but recognised that his jail sentence posed a problem.</p>
<p>Hajim, who says he played in the Moroccan first division before arriving in Italy, impressed when he scored four goals against players from nearby serie A club Udinese in a recent friendly match involving a prison team.</p>
<p>The Moroccan, who would not say what crimes he had committed, is due to be freed in December 1997.</p>
<p>Zearo said he had asked the director of the local prison if Hajim could be granted day release.</p>
<p>&quot;It would be the first case of day release being granted in Italy on sporting grounds,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Prison director Salvatore Pirruccio said he would contact magistrates and let Zearo know their decision.</p>
