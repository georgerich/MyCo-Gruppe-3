<title>CANADA: Canada court freezes Friedland's Inco stock.</title>
<headline>Canada court freezes Friedland's Inco stock.</headline>
<dateline>VANCOUVER, British Columbia</dateline>
<text>
<p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has won a temporary court order in Canada preventing mining financier Robert Friedland from taking possession of $152 million in Inco Ltd. stock he was to receive under Inco's takeover of Diamond Fields Resources Inc., Friedland said Friday.</p>
<p>Friedland said he would challenge the order, issued by the Supreme Court of British Columbia this week. The EPA also won a garnishee order in the U.S. District Court of Colorado on May 25, Friedland said in a statement.</p>
<p>The EPA has been battling Friedland for years over environmental damage at the Summitville gold mine in Colorado. The EPA took control of the site in 1992 after a cyanide leak there. Friedland was chairman and chief executive until 1990 of Galactic Resources Inc., which developed the mine, but he has denied any responsibility for the spill.</p>
<p>Galactic subsequently declared bankruptcy in 1993. The EPA reportedly has already spent more than $100 million on a clean-up at Summitville.</p>
<p>Friedland, who commands a reputation as a shrewd dealmaker, was also founder and co-chairman of Diamond Fields which discovered the vast Voisey's Bay nickel deposit in eastern Canada. Inco, a nickel mining giant, closed a C$4.3 billion ($3.2 billion) takeover of Diamond Fields on Wednesday for cash and stock.</p>
<p>The court-ordered freeze affects about one-third of the Inco shares that Friedland was to receive in exchange for his stake in Diamond Fields, a spokesman said.</p>
<p>Friedland accused the EPA of &quot;stealth&quot; and resorting to &quot;surreptitious and high-handed tactics&quot; in obtaining the freeze. The EPA is seeking to confiscate the stock, he said.</p>
<p>Friedland said he would seek to have the order overturned and was considering suing for damages. Court hearings were held in Vancouver, Toronto and Denver without his knowledge, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;If the EPA thinks I am going to tolerate this high-handed effort to run roughshod over our civil rights, they have been misadvised,&quot; Friedland said.</p>
<p>Friedland claims the agency mishandled the Summitville clean-up job and is trying to hold him responsible for its mistakes. The EPA has &quot;publicly acknowledged&quot; it considers other people unrelated to Friedland responsible for the damage at Summitville in the San Juan Mountains of southwestern Colorado, he said.</p>
<p>He said the orders freezing his Inco shares were obtained &quot;without disclosure of certain material facts to the court&quot; but gave no details.</p>
<p>Friedland said the EPA told the courts he was hiding from the agency. &quot;That is simply ludicrous. The truth is that the EPA has never attempted to serve me with a lawsuit using appropriate legal means,&quot; he said.</p>
