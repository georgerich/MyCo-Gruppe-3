<p>NATO troops in eastern Bosnia transported tonnes of contraband Bosnian Serb ammunition and mines to pits for destruction on Tuesday, pressing on with their &quot;Operation Volcano&quot; mission despite local environmental concerns.</p>
<p>&quot;Serb worries about the local water table have halted work in one set of pits for the moment but the operation continues in a second set of pits,&quot; NATO's Lieutenant-Colonel Max Marriner told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;Operation Volcano is proceeding even as we respond to local environmental concerns. Theoretically we could destroy all the material in the second set of pits or find a third site. The material will be destroyed one way or the other.&quot;</p>
<p>A total of 24 tonnes of munitions were destroyed on Monday in two sets of explosions which sent columns of dirt and dust 300 metres (1,000 feet) into the air.</p>
<p>A routine NATO patrol discovered about 300 tonnes of small arms ammunition, anti-tank and anti-personnel mines in a schoolhouse in Margetici, near Sokolac, on August 5.</p>
<p>Because the Margetici site had not been declared to NATO as required by the Dayton peace agreement, NATO troops confiscated the material and prepared to destroy it.</p>
<p>About 2,000 NATO-led peace implementation troops were despatched to the area from Saturday to ensure Operation Volcano went ahead without risk to local citizens or the environment.</p>
<p>Military engineers dug two sets of blasts pits in a remote area near Margetici to contain the exploding munitions which they detonated in lots of a few tonnes each.</p>
<p>On Monday the Serbs complained that blasts from one set of pits might contaminate local water tables.</p>
<p>Blasting began in the other set of pits while NATO engineers considered the Serb complaint.</p>
<p>Operation Volcano is expected to continue for the rest of the week.</p>
