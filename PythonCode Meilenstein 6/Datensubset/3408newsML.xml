<title>ARGENTINA: Argentine unions suspend strike meet after gunfire.</title>
<headline>Argentine unions suspend strike meet after gunfire.</headline>
<dateline>BUENOS AIRES 1996-08-20</dateline>
<text>
<p>Argentine unions called off Tuesday's meeting due to vote on whether to hold a general strike next month after a gunfight in which at least four members of a truck drivers' union were injured.</p>
<p>Francisco Gutierrez of the main CGT labor federation told reporters the meeting at a union leisure center outside Buenos Aires had been suspended.</p>
<p>The CGT  said there would be a news conference later in the day. Truckers' leader Hugo Moyano, whose union members were shot at while trying to enter the meeting, said four of his colleagues had been injured, one in the chest.  </p>
<p>The meeting of the Central Confederal Committee of unions had been called to vote on proposals to hold a second general strike against the Peronist government's austerity measures, to follow a 24-hour stoppage that took place August 8.</p>
<p>The CGT, which has usually been close to the government but led the last general strike, wants a 36-hour stoppage next month, while more hardline union federations such as the MTA, to which the truckers belong, want it to last 48 hours.</p>
<p>Television footage showed men in civilian dress among the MTA unionists shooting with handguns and flares at the union sports complex near Ezeiza international airport.</p>
<p>But Moyano, who was inside the building where the debate was due to take place, said afterwards that CGT officials had refused entry to his union colleagues who had &quot;just come to listen,&quot; and blamed the CGT for the shootings.</p>
<p>&quot;First we are going to see our wounded colleagues, then we will see what we do,&quot; the truckers' leader told reporters.</p>
<p>CGT chief Gerardo Martinez ruled out the idea that any CGT member was armed and blamed the gunfire on &quot;outside groups who want to damage the image of the unions and make us look like gangsters.&quot;</p>
<p>President Carlos Menem's Chief of Staff Alberto Kohan said the government was &quot;very worried&quot; about the incident. &quot;People who take part in gunfights do not represent the workers, they are delinquents,&quot; Kohan told reporters.</p>
<p>August 8's general strike, which unions say was observed by 90 percent of Argentine workers but the government argues was only a 50 percent success, was marred by violence on a lesser scale when police clashed with unions after preventing them from setting up makeshift soup kitchens in city squares.</p>
