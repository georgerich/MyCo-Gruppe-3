<headline>Lipponen says Finland to decide on ERM soon.</headline>
<dateline>HELSINKI 1996-08-22</dateline>

<p>Finland would decide soon whether to link the markka to the European Union's Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen was quoted as saying on Wednesday.</p>
<p>He also said a further strengthening of the markka was not desirable.</p>
<p>The ERM decision would be made &quot;in the fairly near future&quot;, Lipponen said according to Thursday's edition of daily Helsingin Sanomat. &quot;I cannot say anything more specific about the timing. The government analyses an ERM link together with the Bank of Finland.&quot;</p>
<p>Speaking at the Social Democratic Party's executive committee meeting in Kuopio in central Finland, Lipponen did not say whether a decision would be made before or after Finland's October 20 local and European parliament elections.</p>
<p>&quot;The markka has strengthened and I doubt it would be desirable that it would strengthen terribly much more. It is not realistic considering our economy compared to other countries,&quot; he was quoted as saying by the Finnish news agency (STT).</p>
<p>The government has said that a decision for or against joining ERM would have to be made this autumn, last repeated by Finance Minister Sauli Niinisto two weeks ago.</p>
<p>Since early May, the markka has strenghened almost five percent against the mark, over five percent compared the the ECU basket and eight percent against the dollar.</p>
<p>On Thursday, an advisor to the Finnish Prime Minister confirmed that Lipponen had said on Wednesday evening that a further strengthening of the markka was not justified.</p>
<p>&quot;He said that a further strengthening is not justified when one looks at purchase power parities,&quot; the advisor told Reuters.</p>
<p>The advisor said he did not know exactly what Lipponen had said about the timetable for a decision whether to link the markka to Europe's exchange rate mechanism (ERM).</p>
<p>&quot;He talked, as before, about this autumn,&quot; the advisor said.</p>
<p>But the advisor said he had not been right by Lipponen's side all the time, and so could not confirm or deny media reports that the prime minister had said a decision would be made &quot;in a fairly near future.&quot;</p>
<p>The Bank of Finland's board of parliamentary supervisors will meet next week to review Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) and the exchange rate mechanism, supervisory board chairman Ilkka Kanerva said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;We meet next week to take a look at the economy, at EMU and at the ERM issue,&quot; Kanerva told Reuters by telephone.</p>
<p>He declined to comment on remarks made by Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen on Wednesday evening that a further strengthening of the markka was not justified and that a decision for or against pegging the markka to ERM would be made in a fairly near future.</p>
<p>Kanerva said he personally regarded it as &quot;highly unlikely that any move would be made on this front (ERM) already next week.&quot; The supervisory board meeting starts on Tuesday at 1600/1300 GMT.</p>
<p>&quot;The government has not approached us on this subject, nor have Bank of Finland officials,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>According to the Currency Act, a proposal to link the markka -- floating since September 1992 -- to ERM would be given by the central bank's board of management to the board of supervisors, which would pass the proposal to the government.</p>
