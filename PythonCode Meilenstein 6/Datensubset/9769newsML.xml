<title>NETHERLANDS: Dutch closing debt market report.</title>

<p>Dutch bonds closed firmer, boosted by surprise cuts in German and Dutch money market rates, though dealers said sentiment remained far from euphoric.</p>
<p>Prices were up 0.30 to 0.40 basis points by the close, but this only partially erased losses of around 0.60 basis points at the long end incurred on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Virtually all of the price gains were posted after the Bundesbank announced a surprise cut of 30 basis points in its repo rate which had been fixed at 3.30 percent since February.</p>
<p>The Dutch central bank later followed suit, trimming its equivalent special advances rate 20 basis points to 2.5 percent.  </p>
<p>The Dutch government closed sales of its new 5.75 percent 2002 bond after raising 5.2 billion guilders on Thursday for a total amount of 7.5 billion since sales opened on Monday.</p>
<p>The Finance Ministry's capital markets agency said the final amount included 1.4 billion guilders worth of bonds taken up by the agency itself which will be gradually sold into the market.</p>
<p>Dutch July consumer price inflation data is due on Friday morning and economists expect to see the year-on-year inflation rate edge up to 2.0 percent from 1.8 percent in June.</p>
<p>Hopes that the Bundesbank council would cut the repo rate at today's first meeting after its summer break had largely faded following new evidence on Wednesday of German economic strength.</p>
<p>Even those who were still harbouring such hopes had mostly reckoned on a smaller cut.</p>
<p>Dealers said sentiment remained nervous despite the cuts, adding that prices could fall sharply at the short end if signs of strong economic growth emerged in the U.S. and Germany.</p>
<p>&quot;If the idea gains ground that the economy is taking off, then the short end will collapse and the yield curve will flatten quite dramatically,&quot; said one dealer. -- Amsterdam newsroom +31 20 504 5000, Fax +31 20 504 5040</p>
