<p>World Food Programme officials said on Tuesday the Bangladesh government planned commercial imports of 100,000 tonnes of soft wheat for November shipment.</p>
<p>&quot;But the purchase may be delayed if the present high price of wheat in the international market continues,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>The officials said Bangladesh's private traders were also expected to import 50,000 tonnes of rice and 10,000 tonnes of wheat for shipment in November.</p>
<p>Food ministry officials, however, said the government had not yet floated any tender for the wheat imports.  </p>
<p>Finance Ministry officials said Bangladesh had received food aid commitments of 124,000 tonnes of wheat for fiscal year 1996/97 which started on July 1. Some 23,000 tonnes of this wheat aid would be provided by the United States under an agreement signed on August 7, one said.</p>
<p>The officials said the European Union would grant Bangladesh 40,000 tonnes of wheat aid this year. They gave no other details.</p>
