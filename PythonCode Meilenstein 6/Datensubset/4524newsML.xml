<p>Rupert Murdoch's News Corp Ltd is expected to report on Thursday a stagnant net profit for the year to June 30, held back by soaring newsprint costs and losses from its burgeoning Star TV operations, analysts said.</p>
<p>The median forecast in BZW's BARCEPS broker survey is for a A$1.343 billion net profit before abnormals for the year, a virtual replica of the A$1.342 billion profit posted in 1994/95.</p>
<p>Analysts said News may even struggle to match last year's result, particularly given its lower than expected third quarter result.  </p>
<p>&quot;It's got to be a reasonably strong last quarter to match that (1994/95) figure,&quot; said ABN AMRO Hoare Govett media analyst John Bell.</p>
<p>&quot;I doubt there'll be many surprises on the upside,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>News posted a A$281 million net profit before abnormals in the third quarter, below expectations of about A$300 million and taking profits for the first nine months of the year to A$944 million.</p>
<p>The result is expected around 8.30 a.m. Australian time on Thursday (2230 GMT Wednesday).  </p>
<p>Analysts said News' 1995/96 profits had been restrained generally by the higher paper costs, a U.K. cover price war and continued losses from its Star TV operation in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>&quot;People will look at newspapers because that will reflect higher newsprint prices and the impact of the newspaper price war,&quot; said one Melbourne media analyst.</p>
<p>Margins on News' British newspapers were seen pressured in the final few months of the year by cover price discounts ahead of the Olympics.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a little bit of renewed competition on the Monday cover prices pre-Olympics,&quot; Bell said.  </p>
<p>&quot;Margins may have slipped a little bit in the last few months of the year,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Star TV was seen pumping out another US$90 million to US$100 million of losses for the year as it establishes itself in the potentially lucrative Asian satellite television markets.</p>
<p>&quot;I would expect a full year loss of US$90 million given what we've been told so far and I've seen nothing to change that,&quot; the Melbourne analyst said.</p>
<p>&quot;I would see it somewhere in excess of of US$100 million,&quot; Bell said.  </p>
<p>Continued strong earnings from U.S. television and films are seen offsetting somewhat the newsprint and Star TV losses.</p>
<p>Looking ahead however, analysts are confident News' profits can start growing again in 1996/97, boosted by potentially lower newsprint prices and an earnings surge from the hit U.S. special effects movie, &quot;Independence Day&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;'Independence Day' could add up to US$200 million to the bottom line,&quot; said Bell, who forecast net profit rising to A$1.5 billion in 1996/97.  </p>
<p>&quot;The 1996/97 result will show some clear profit growth as much as anything because of paper prices and 'Independence Day',&quot; the Melbourne analyst said, who forecast a A$1.6 billion net profit.</p>
<p>News' share price was down one cent at A$6.49 at 2.00 p.m. (0400 GMT).</p>
