<title>RUSSIA: Bomb damages Moscow synagogue.</title>

<p>A bomb broke windows and knocked over holy scrolls at a new Moscow synagogue late on Thursday in what its rabbi said was a deliberate attack on Jews</p>
<p>&quot;This was clearly an anti-semitic act,&quot; Rabbi Berel Lazar, of the Marina Roshcha synagogue and a member of the U.S.-based Lubavitch Jewish organisation, said in a statement.</p>
<p>The brick synagogue, which replaced an older wooden one burnt down by an arsonist in 1993, opened only in June.</p>
<p>Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) told Itar-Tass news agency that the device, containing about 300 grams (10 ounces) of explosive, did not appear to be linked to bombs placed on Moscow trains and buses in the past two months.</p>
<p>The blast, against an outer wall, dislodged bricks and shattered windows in the two-storey building, sending glass showering over the spartan interior. The ark housing the sacred Torah scrolls was jolted, knocking the scrolls over.</p>
<p>Vladimir Kuravsky, of the religious community's staff, told Reuters there was about $15,000 worth of damage. But the congregation would not be discouraged and would go ahead with plans for a larger building.</p>
<p>Its wooden predecessor had served as a centre for Russian Judaism during the seven decades of communist repression.</p>
<p>The Lubavich organisation is very active in Russia. The country, and Moscow in particular, has a sizable Jewish community despite recent emigration.</p>
<p>But the lack of religious instruction in Soviet times means many Russian Jews have little knowledge of their faith.</p>
