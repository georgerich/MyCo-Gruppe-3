<p>Palestinians accused Israel's right-wing government of barring Yasser Arafat from flying by helicopter to the West Bank on Thursday for a meeting with former Israeli prime minister Shimon Peres.</p>
<p>&quot;The Palestinian side was informed that Arafat won't be allowed to fly to Ramallah because he was supposed to meet Peres later in the day,&quot; a senior Palestinian security source in the West Bank town of Ramallah told Reuters.  </p>
<p>Palestinian peace negotiator Hassan Asfour charged that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has accused opposition Labour party leader Peres of trying to undermine his Likud government's authority, of personally barring the flight.</p>
<p>An Israeli army spokesman quoted Herzl Getz, chief of Israel's Security Liaison Committee with the Palestinians, as saying all technical details relating to the flight, which must overfly Israeli territory, had been approved by the military.</p>
<p>&quot;We are still waiting for permission from the political level,&quot; the spokesman quoted Getz as saying. There was no immediate comment from Netanyahu's office.</p>
<p>A Palestinian security source described Palestinian President Arafat as &quot;furious&quot; over the alleged Israeli ban.</p>
