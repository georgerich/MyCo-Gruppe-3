<p>Britain's sickly manufacturing sector showed a slight sign of recovery in August with firms reporting a modest rise in overall demand, the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said on Friday.</p>
<p>But its August industrial trends survey found orders were still well below normal levels for the time of year, hit in particular by sluggish demand for British goods abroad.</p>
<p>Only 19 percent of firms saw orders rise, compared with 29 percent who saw them fall. Firms have regarded orders as below normal for the time of year for 12 months in a row.</p>
<p>&quot;Although manufacturing demand has improved to its best level so far this year, companies will find it difficult to raise more than one cheer,&quot; said Sudhir Junankar, associate director of economic analysis at the CBI.</p>
<p>He said total order books remained significantly below normal despite some improvement in home demand.</p>
<p>The survey showed demand from overseas had weakened further, leaving export order books in their worst state since February 1994. Junankar said the European market in particular showed little sign of improvement with France and Germany very weak.</p>
<p>Excessive stock levels continued to dog the industry but fewer firms than last month reported stocks of finished goods were more than adequate to meet expected demand.</p>
<p>Given the persistently low level of demand, firms said they did not expect to raise their prices over the next four months.</p>
<p>But the beleaguered manufacturing sector will contribute significantly to output growth next year, the CBI said in its latest quarterly economic forecast, also released on Friday.</p>
<p>The CBI forecasts manufacturing output will grow by 3.9 percent next year, a marginal downward revision from its previous forecast made in May, while its 1996 forecast has been revised down to 0.6 percent from 1.0 percent at the last round.</p>
<p>Output grew by 2.2 percent in 1995.</p>
<p>The CBI also forecast steady, unspectacular growth in gross domestic product (GDP) to continue in 1996 but said there was no need for another interest rate cut.</p>
<p>&quot;Our stance is that interest rates should be left on hold,&quot; said Kate Barker, the CBI's chief economic adviser. &quot;The risk of a new recession is only slight</p>
<p>It forecast that GDP would grow 2.0 percent in 1996 with activity picking up to 3.1 percent in 1997.</p>
