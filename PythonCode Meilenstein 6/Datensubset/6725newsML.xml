<p>A surprise fall in UK retail sales in July has given Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke fresh ammunition for another interest rate cut, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;This gives Clarke a real window of opportunity for the September 4 meeting,&quot; said Philip Uglow, economist at Union Plc. &quot;It will be a close call.&quot;</p>
<p>Retail sales fell 0.6 percent in July, taking the year-on-year rate of growth down to 2.2 percent from 3.4 in June. Economists had forecast a modest monthly rise of around 0.2 percent.  </p>
<p>Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke and Bank of England Governor Eddie George meet in early September for their monthly discussion of monetary policy.</p>
<p>Uglow said recent official statistics had gone very much Clarke's way should he wish to push for another rate cut.</p>
<p>He noted manufacturing output fell 0.3 percent in June, giving no indication of a revival in UK industry's fortunes.</p>
<p>And on Monday, M4 money supply growth dropped sharply to 8.8 percent year-on-year in July, taking it back into the government's three-to-nine percent monitoring range for the first time since November.  </p>
<p>The Bank of England has consistently expressed its concerns about the inflationary implications of broad money growth. &quot;It really does strengthen the Chancellor's hand,&quot; Uglow said.</p>
<p>Other analysts said the fall in sales in July should be taken with a pinch of salt.</p>
<p>&quot;What is important is the three-month underlying trend,&quot; Andrew Milligan, economist at General Accident, told Reuters Financial Television. &quot;That is still showing a strong uptrend.&quot; Retail sales for the three months to the end of July were 1.1 percent higher than in the previous three months and 2.7 percent above the same period a year ago.  </p>
<p>Uglow said the 2.2 percent fall in textiles, clothing and footwear sales in July -- a major factor behind the drop in sales overall -- had to be put in the context of a rocketing 5.6 percent rise in June.</p>
<p>&quot;Clothing and footwear sales shot up in June, it was unseasonally hot then. Now, they've simply fallen back.&quot;</p>
<p>That also applied to the overall retail sales figure. Up 1.3 percent on the month in June, a fallback in July was to be expected, Uglow said, adding that retailers may have brought forward their summer sales to June.  </p>
<p>Jonathan Loynes, UK economist at HSBC Markets, agreed the underlying rise in high street sales remained in place.</p>
<p>&quot;Taking July's figures together with the sharp jump in sales in June, it is clear that the trend in high street spending is still quite firmly upwards,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But he added Wednesday's figures would douse fears of a return to 1980s boom conditions. &quot;Along with yesterday's slowdown in broad money supply growth, it will provide useful ammunition for Mr Clarke in the base rate debate.&quot;</p>
<p>Loynes forecast one more quarter-point rate cut in the autumn, taking base rates to 5.50 percent.  </p>
<p>Uglow said the odds on another rate cut were too difficult to call given the Bank of England's rigid refusal, in its recent inflation report, to countenance another easing of monetary policy.</p>
<p>In its quarterly report, the Bank said the focus should switch to when rates will rise, not fall again.</p>
<p>&quot;The Bank has been very vociferous about no more rate cuts. But, regardless of that, there are now real chances of another move in September,&quot; Uglow said.</p>
