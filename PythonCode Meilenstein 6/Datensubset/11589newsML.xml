<title>UK: BP to seek Schiehallion terminal bids by year-end.</title>
<headline>BP to seek Schiehallion terminal bids by year-end.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-08-23</dateline>

<p>British Petroleum Co Plc will begin seeking bids from ports interested in transshipping oil from its Schiehallion field west of the Shetland Islands in the next few months, industry sources said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;It will kick-off between now and the end of the year,&quot; said a source familiar with the project.</p>
<p>The Schiehallion field, which was discovered in late 1993 and should come on stream in early 1998, has estimated recoverable reserves of over 400 million barrels of oil.</p>
<p>It will be developed using a Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) vessel to be built at Belfast's Harland &amp; Wolff shipyard.</p>
<p>The FPSO will have a capacity to process about 140,000 barrels per day (bpd). BP expects output to peak around the end of the decade at over 120,000 bpd, most of which will be taken by shuttle tanker to a port to enable customers to load bigger vessels from storage.</p>
<p>BP's co-venturers in the 900 million stg development are Royal Dutch/Shell, Amerada Hess Corp, Statoil unit Aran Energy Plc, OMV AG and Murphy Petroleum.</p>
<p>From advertising for bids to selecting the port will take four to six months, industry sources said.</p>
<p>The Flotta terminal in the Orkney Islands won the contract to transship Foinaven crude against competition from Sullom Voe in the Shetland Islands, Nigg on the northeast coast of Scotland and Rotterdam in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>All four ports are likely to be contenders for the Schiehallion contract, the sources said.</p>
<p>The Shetlands are expected to mount a strong case for Schiehallion crude, having earlier this month secured the future of the Sullom Voe terminal by clinching a new deal with the 28 oil companies who use it to export Brent.</p>
<p>The deal should run for 25 years and requires the companies to give two years' notice of any intention to quit.</p>
<p>Shetland Island Council sources said the uncertainty about the future of the terminal had seriously undermined its attempts to win the Foinaven deal.</p>
<p>Foinaven, which will pump the first commercial crude from the hostile waters west of the Shetlands, is unlikely be brought on stream before early 1997 -- six months later than originally planned -- because of the discovery of a crack in a subsea manifold.</p>
<p>BP is still waiting for metallurgists to complete their investigation into the causes of the problem.</p>
<p>&quot;It is taking a long time but we've told them to take as long as it takes...We are not prepared to put on the seabed something which could damage the environment,&quot; said a BP official.</p>
