<headline>Russia MinFins ease on bond freeze worry, Yeltsin.</headline>

<p>Prices of Russian MinFin bonds fell on Wednesday on rumours, later denied, that more bonds had been frozen and worries about President Boris Yeltsin's health and a Russian bombing offensive in the Chechen capital Grozny and dealers said.</p>
<p>		 tranche  Aug 21		  Aug 20</p>
<p> 1999 maturity (3)    74.90-75.20	   76.15-76.45</p>
<p> 2003 maturity (4)    47.80-48.10	   49.30-49.60</p>
<p> 2008 maturity (5)    31.20-31.50	   32.35-33.65</p>
<p> 2006 maturity (6)    37.00-37.30	   37.80-38.10</p>
<p> 2011 maturity (7)    27.30-27.60	   28.40-28.70</p>
<p>Prices started falling in early trading mainly on rumours some banks had some of their bonds frozen, dealers said.</p>
<p>But a finance ministry official who declined to be named told Reuters on Wednesday that no new bonds had been frozen.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not have such information (about freezing new bonds), there is nothing new about this matter,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>One dealer said &quot;Prices rose some 0.5 point after this news, but the fall started again as the market, mainly abroad, is generally unhappy about these rumours and those about Yeltsin, as well as bombing of Grozny.&quot;</p>
<p>The presidential press service said earlier that Yeltsin, resting in north-western Russia, had signed two decrees today.</p>
<p>Asked about rumours in Western financial markets that Yeltsin was dead, a service spokesman answered &quot;I think he is alive. He has been signing decrees.&quot;</p>
<p>Dealers said prices broke through support for the third, fourth and fifth tranches at 75.00, 45.00 and 31.00, respectively. Not all Russian banks trade the sixth and seventh tranches.</p>
<p>They expected the down trend to continue for the rest of the day.</p>
<p>&quot;Prices keep on falling, and they could ease more when U.S. operators step in... Current prices are still good for selling after last week's jump,&quot; a Russian bank dealer said.</p>
