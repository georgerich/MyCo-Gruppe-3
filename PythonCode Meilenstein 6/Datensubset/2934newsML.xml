<p>COMEX copper settled lower as the market gave back Monday's gains, though prices were still locked inside a tight trading range established several weeks ago.</p>
<p>Although December has most open interest, traders were keeping an eye on the September contract for signs of break out from the 90.00 to 94.00 cents per pound range.</p>
<p>&quot;We had a lot of shorts stopped out yesterday, and we added some shorts today,&quot; a COMEX floor source said.</p>
<p>December copper went out 1.95 cents lower at 89.00 cents, traded 90.40 to 88.70 cents. September settled 2.35 cents off at 90.90 cents with spot August down 2.25 cents at 91.20 cents.</p>
<p>Richard Hirsch of Deutsche Sharps Pixley Metals said COMEX closed significantly higher than LME on Monday therefore some of the gains had to be given up on Tuesday's opening.</p>
<p>&quot;We are locked in a rigid sideways range pattern - once again after rallying above the congestion on Monday we fell back into it sharply,&quot; Hirsch said.</p>
<p>Trading was routine with little fresh news. LME stocks rose 5,000 tonnes to 226,000 tonnes, in line with market expectations.</p>
