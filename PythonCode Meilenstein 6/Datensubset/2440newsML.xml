<p>The Philippines' top military officer said on Tuesday Manila was exchanging intelligence information with the United States and other countries on potential terrorist threats to the APEC summit later this year.</p>
<p>&quot;Certainly those countries going to APEC must exchange information and talk of possible security problems,&quot; Philippine armed forces chief General Arturo Enrile said in an interview at the end of a three-day visit to Singapore.</p>
<p>Manila is taking elaborate security precautions for the summit of leaders of the 18 members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum when it is held in the Philippines this November. U.S. President Bill Clinton is expected to attend.</p>
<p>Enrile said among particular concerns were Islamic militant groups such as Hamas.</p>
<p>He said Hamas also has links with the radical Abu Sayyaf group responsible for a string of bomb attacks and the abduction of foreign priests and nuns in the southern Philippines.</p>
<p>&quot;At the moment, we don't see them posing a threat because the security preparations have been very, very thorough,&quot; Enrile said.</p>
<p>The Philippines said on Monday it would deploy a force of 10,000 men picked from the army and police when the APEC leaders meet on November 25 at the former U.S. Subic naval base north of Manila.</p>
<p>APEC is a regional group which hopes to convert the Asia- Pacific region into a free trade zone.</p>
<p>The members are Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and the United States.</p>
