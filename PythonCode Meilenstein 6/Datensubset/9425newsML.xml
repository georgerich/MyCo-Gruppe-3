<p>China will cut its bank deposit rates by an average of 1.5 percentage points and its lending rates by 1.2 percentage points, effective on Friday, the official Xinhua news agency said on Thursday.  </p>
<p>Xinhua said that the new rates on basic bank savings accounts would be 1.98 percent, while three-month fixed deposits would be 3.33 percent, six-month fixed deposits 5.4 percent, one year 7.47 percent, two years 7.92 percent, three years 8.28 percent and five years 9.0 percent.</p>
<p>It said interest rates on loans for operating funds would be cut to 9.18 percent for six months and 10.08 percent for one year. Interest on loans for investment in fixed assets would be 10.08 percent for up to one year, 10.98 percent for one to three years, 11.7 percent for three to five years and 12.42 percent for five years or more, Xinhua said.  </p>
<p>Xinhua said that the cut by the People's Bank of China, the central bank, was in response to an easing of inflation and was aimed at further reducing the interest burden on state enterprises.</p>
<p>It also said the reduction did not indicate that the central bank, which sets China's interest rates, was abandoning its policy of maintaining &quot;appropriately tight monetary policies&quot;.</p>
<p>Xinhua said that inflation had eased but some inflationary pressures remained.</p>
<p>It said the cuts would help the nation attain its goal of keeping inflation below economic growth and &quot;appropriately increasing&quot; money supply.</p>
<p>It went on to say that the problems of state enterprises, which have been strapped for cash because of a credit squeeze and inefficient operations, could not be resolved solely by an easing of monetary policies.</p>
<p>It said this required continued implementation of the macro-economic policies now in effect and the use of interest rates and other monetary tools to adjust money supply.</p>
