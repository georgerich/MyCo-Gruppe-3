<p>British Sky Broadcasting said on Tuesday it had not been charged mainstream UK corporation tax in its last financial year and did not expect to do so in the current year.</p>
<p>Finance director Richard Brooke said the company did not expect to pay corporation tax until 1997/98.</p>
<p>The company said in its results statement for the year to June 30, 1996 that there was no charge &quot;as each company in the Group either incurred losses or made profits which were offset by tax losses brought forward or by group relief.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There remain within the Group substantial tax losses and other timing differences which are expected to be available in the future to offset against Mainstream Corporation Tax liabilities,&quot; the statement added.</p>
<p>It said that during the year just ended the company had provided for 23.6 million stg of Advance Corporation Tax (ACT) on the year's dividends.</p>
