<p>Russia's Yevgeny Kafelnikov, ranked fourth in world tennis, withdrew from the Hamlet Cup tournament on Tuesday with a rib injury suffered in practice, leaving his participation in next week's U.S. Open in doubt.</p>
<p>Kafelnikov, the tournament's second seed, was ordered to rest by his orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Nathan Breazeale, who said that Kafelnikov, the French Open champion and two-time Hamlet Cup defender, had suffered &quot;a lower left side and back rib strain.&quot;</p>
<p>Kafelnikov was in obvious discomfort when he spoke to reporters. &quot;I don't know about the Open,&quot; he said. &quot;I plan to stay in the draw but if I don't play tennis until Friday, I can't play the Open. I'd be out of shape and can't compete 100 percent like you have to in the Open.&quot;</p>
<p>The U.S. Open draw is scheduled to be completed Wednesday.</p>
<p>The 22-year-old Kafelnikov said the injury happened suddenly while he was on a practice court. &quot;I played a few holes of golf in the morning,&quot; he said, &quot;and then I was on the court twenty minutes when, Boom, I felt a sharp pain in my back all of a sudden.&quot;</p>
<p>Breazeale said the injury would require patience. &quot;It's a rotational problem and very temporary,&quot; the doctor explained. &quot;He has responded to treatment of anti-inflammatory medication, heat and massage and he should rest it about three days. It's a common injury but by playing now he could aggravate it.&quot;</p>
<p>While Kafelnikov was receiving medical treatment, third-seeded Richey Reneberg of the U.S., and fifth-seeded Andrei Medvedev of Ukraine advanced in early first round matches.</p>
<p>Reneberg eliminated Shuzo Matsuoka of Japan 6-4 6-2 in 67 minutes and Medvedev rallied to defeat Russia's Alexander Volkov 4-6 6-2 6-2.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, unseeded Romanian Adrian Voinea beat seventh-seeded Hendrik Dreekman of Germany 6-3 6-4 in 65 minutes.</p>
