<text>
<p>Blue-chip stocks were swept higher Thursday by renewed strength in battered technology shares and a surprisingly steep German rate cut that bolstered European exchanges.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones industrial average ended up 43.65 points at 5,733.47, putting the index less than 45 points from its record closing high of 5,778.00 set on May 22.</p>
<p>In the broader market, advancing issues swept declines 1,477 to 857 on moderately active volume of 354 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq Composite index, which is laced with technology shares, jumped 17.12 points to 1,143.96.</p>
<p>The big news was the German central bank's decision to slash its main money market interest rate to a historic low of 3.00 percent from 3.30 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;It was definitely a plus in a modest summer rally here. One that should take us to new highs,&quot; said Allen Sinai, chief economist Lehman Brothers Global Economic Advisors.</p>
<p>There was speculation that the German move, which was quickly followed by other central banks in European and Canada, might take some of the pressure off the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in the coming months.</p>
<p>&quot;There's the expectation a further German cut will take the heat off other central bankers including our own,&quot; said Robert Stovall, president of Stovall/Twenty-First.</p>
<p>The Fed left interest rates unchanged at its meeting Tuesday, but some economists expect the rates to be raised after the Nov. 5th Presidential election.</p>
<p>Recent economic data suggested that consumer spending and the labour market were heating up in August, although signs of a slowing manufacturing sector were seen as offsetting the growth signals.</p>
<p>The German rate cut lifted the British stock market to a record close and other exchanges also posted solid gains.</p>
<p>Analysts said the recovery in technology stocks after several weeks of battering boosted sentiment on Wall Street.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the bear market in technology is over,&quot; said Alfred Goldman, technical research director at A.G. Edwards.</p>
<p>Stronger technology issues included Intel, which rose 2-3/4 to 83 after Smith Barney upgraded the stock. Microsoft was up 1-1/2 to 125, International Business Machines added 3/8 to 113, Cisco Systems was up 1-3/8 to 57-5/8 and Hewlett-Packard rose 1-1/8 to 43.</p>
<p>Tobacco stocks remained under pressure as Oklahoma became the 14th state to sue the industry, and investors nervously awaited the outcome of a key tobacco liability case in Indianapolis. The case went to the jury on Thursday.</p>
<p>Philip Morris was the most-active NYSE issue, falling 3/4 to 86-7/8. RJR Nabisco, parent of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, slipped 1/8 to 25-1/4, smokeless tobacco maker UST Inc. fell 1/8 to 30-3/4 and Loews lost 1-1/2 to 75-1/8.</p>
<p>Among other issues, Zenith Electronics climbed 5-1/2 to 16-7/8 after programming venture Americast signed a $1 billion contract with Zenith to buy at least three million digital set-top boxes for its home entertainment service. Americast is a consortium between Ameritch, South Corp., GTE, SBC Communications and Walt Disney.</p>
<p>SDL Inc. slumped 9 to 19 after forecasting that its revenues for the third quarter will be &quot;at best&quot; unchanged from the second quarter due to manufacturing difficulties.</p>
<p>Dura Pharmaceutricals climbed 5-3/4 to 32-1/2 after Eli Lilly agreed to give Dura exclusive U.S. marketing rights to Lilly's patented antibiotics Ceclor CD and Keftab. Lilly rose 3/8 to 59-3/4.</p>
<p>Veritas Software climbed 8 to 48-1/4. The company said it formed a strategic alliance with Microsoft to deliver its volume manager disk and storage management software in Microsoft's fast-growing operating system.</p>
<p>The Standard &amp; Poor's composite index of 500 stocks rose 5.61 to 670.68. The American Stock Exchange index rose 2.64 to 560.32.</p>
<p>The NYSE Composite index of all listed common stocks rose 2.61 to 358.72. The average share was up 28 cents.</p>
<p>The Wilshire Associates Equity Index -- the market value of NYSE, American and Nasdaq issues -- was 6,551.823 up 55.129 or 0.85 percent.</p>
