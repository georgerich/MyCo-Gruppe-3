<p>President Boris Yeltsin headed for the picturesque lakeland of Valdai in northwestern Russia on Tuesday for a two-day break outside Moscow, the presidential press service said.</p>
<p>It said that the 65-year-old Kremlin leader, whose virtual disappearance from public view in late June triggered rumours about his health, would consider whether it was a good enough place to spend the rest of his planned vacation.</p>
<p>&quot;It is expected that Boris Yeltsin will return to Moscow this week where he will hold a series of meetings with members of the government,&quot; a spokesman said.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, who suffered two heart attacks last year, has made only one public appearence since June 26, briefly turning up at his inauguration ceremony on August 9.</p>
<p>Aides say he suffered &quot;colossal weariness&quot; after his re-election campaign, but they deny he has suffered new heart trouble.</p>
<p>Yeltsin's press secretary, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, on Monday denied a report by the U.S. magazine Time which said that Yeltsin had suffered from heart problems again in the second half of June.</p>
<p>Time said that, according to an official Kremlin medical advisory it had obtained, the president needed round-the-clock monitoring and the Kremlin was considering transferring him to a Swiss clinic for a bypass operation.</p>
<p>&quot;This information is part of a series of rumours and conjectures concerning the state of the president's health,&quot; Yastrzhembsky told a news briefing.</p>
<p>He said that the president, whom he had met recently, has been doing paperwork every day at a residence near Moscow.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, who usually spends vacations at the Black Sea resort of Sochi, had been expected to start a holiday outside Moscow after his inauguration.</p>
<p>Valdai, about 350 km (220 miles) northwest of the capital, had been mentioned by aides as a possible destination.</p>
<p>The area, a mixture of thick woods and hundreds of lakes where Russia's River Volga originates, is a long-time resort area popular for mild climate and beautiful nature.</p>
