<headline>IPE Sept gas oil ends weaker, backwardation eases.</headline>

<p>IPE gas oil futures closed narrowly lower on Tuesday after a quiet session with most activity concentrated on the prompt spread, dealers said.</p>
<p>September gas oil settled at $188.25 a tonne, down 25 cents but towards the middle of the session's range of $186.50-$189.00 a tonne.</p>
<p>&quot;Gas oil's been pretty quiet today apart from some interest in the Sept/Oct (spread),&quot; said a broker.</p>
<p>The prompt intermonth spread shed 75 cents a tonne to stand at +$1.25, under pressure from expectations that API data due later on Tuesday will record a build in U.S. inventories.  </p>
<p>Shortfalls in U.S. stocks of middle distillates -- mainly heating oil and diesel -- have boosted the entire energy complex in recent weeks.</p>
<p>IPE Brent crude continued to trade a narrow range, pulled lower by mild profit-taking after Monday's rally but meeting solid support from independent dealers on the exchange floor.</p>
<p>&quot;The locals have been buying the dips today but basically the market has paused,&quot; said a broker.</p>
<p>Oct Brent shed 19 cents to trade at $20.66 a barrel by 1646 GMT after posting a session low of $20.58 around midday. The expiry of Sept NYMEX crude at the close kept volumes thin.  </p>
<p>&quot;There's been very little paper going through this afternoon,&quot; said a broker.</p>
<p>&quot;People are waiting for Sept to expire and then resume normal business tomorrow.&quot;</p>
<p>Dealers said they saw floor interest in the Brent-NYMEX crude arbitrage, with locals buying October Brent and selling October NYMEX crude. The Oct spread narrowed by two cents to $1.44 a barrel.</p>
