<p>Emerging market countries are once again focusing on the Euromark sector to raise funds after a slow second quarter, new issues traders said this week.</p>
<p>A surge in demand for high-yielding Euromark paper from European retail investors has led to tighter spreads on sovereign paper and recent deals have proved successful, they added. And further transactions are in the pipeline.</p>
<p>&quot;There is still a lot of good retail thirst in Germany for emerging market product, as it offers juicy coupons,&quot; a syndicate manager in Frankfurt said.</p>
<p>&quot;Sovereigns also like their paper to be held in retail hands as buyers tend to hold it until full maturity,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Emerging market Euromark issuance swelled at the beginning of 1996, continuing the trend seen in 1995. (See complete list below).</p>
<p>Excessive supply led to a period of saturation in the sector and a lull in volume, but currently renewed demand is now driving issuance, syndicate officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are seeing overwhelming demand again for high-yielding mark paper after the lull in the sector given the large volumes early this year...Turkey's recent mark Eurobond had a very good response in the market,&quot; one syndicate official in Frankfurt said. But he said there was still some caution with regards to the size and maturity of the issues.</p>
<p>&quot;Shorter maturities are favoured with a maximum of up to about seven years,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>But another syndicate official said buyers were not so sensitive to the maturity but were more focussed on the coupon. &quot;German investors can get up to six percent domestically, so they look for higher coupons from emerging market borrowers,&quot; the syndicate official said.</p>
<p>Following is a list of emerging market countries that have raised marks in the international bond market since the beginning of 1995 up to the present.</p>
<p>Increased investor confidence and hunger for high coupons have sharply reduced spreads over German government paper in this period.</p>
