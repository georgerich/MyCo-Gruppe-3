<p>While shares of Philip Morris Cos Inc steadied on Friday after being rocked by a new string of tobacco liability lawsuits against the company, options trading continued active on both sides of the tape.</p>
<p>By Friday afternoon, Philip Morris shares were up 1/2 at 87-1/4. For the week, the stock was down 1-3/8. Two weeks ago it was trading above 106.</p>
<p>Philip Morris puts and calls continued active on the American Stock Exchange, led by the September 95 call, which traded 3,860 contracts. It was up 1/16 at 1/2.  </p>
<p>Other actives included the September 90 call with 3,170 contracts, the September 80 put with nearly 3,000 contracts traded and the September 85 put with 1,950 traded.</p>
<p>With the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of a lawsuit in Indianapolis and the launching of several new lawsuits this week hanging in the air, volatility in the September options remained high as investors played for either side -- a rebound or further drop in the stock.</p>
<p>&quot;The September calls and puts are still trading at high volatilities,&quot; said Marty Kearney at PTI Securities.  </p>
<p>He explained that the historic volatility was around 31 and that the out-of-the-money September 90 and 95 calls were trading at a volatility between about 37-1/2 and 38-1/2.</p>
<p>The September 85 puts were trading at a volatility around 42 and the September 80 puts had a volatility around 40.</p>
<p>He said the high volatility was not surprising given the uncertainty surrounding the stock.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a good mix of out-of-the-money puts and calls,&quot; one trader said. &quot;People are playing for a little dip or a little rally.&quot;  </p>
<p>Rod Jamieson, vice president of options strategy at EVEREN Securities, said buyers of straddles and strangles were seen in the past few days, but by Friday those strategies had become expensive.</p>
<p>&quot;They're pretty pumped up, pretty expensive,&quot; Jamieson said. &quot;So now what I had today is I see some guys coming in and selling some puts.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yesterday, we had some people buying puts and calls, looking for a big swing, but that (85) straddle is priced at 8-7/8.&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;A nine-point move -- whether that happens or not, I don't know,&quot; Jamieson said. &quot;But I would think that buying that straddle doesn't make a whole lot of sense here.&quot;</p>
<p>Some investors were seen picking up the shares because of Philip Morris's $1 a share quarterly dividend and hopes for a dividend increase next week.</p>
