<title>AUSTRALIA: Australian savings ratios revised up by ABS.</title>
<headline>Australian savings ratios revised up by ABS.</headline>
<dateline>CANBERRA 1996-08-20</dateline>
<text>
<p>Australia's savings ratios for recent quarters have been revised up significantly, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) said in its June quarter gross domestic product (GDP) release.</p>
<p>After originally being reported at close to zero, the March quarter seasonally adjusted househould savings ratio was revised up to 2.2 percent.</p>
<p>The June quarter ratio was 3.3 percent.  </p>
<p>The ABS said the savings ratio had been revised up for recent quarters as a result of incorporating revised annual estimates for various aggregates and initial annual estimates for 1995/96 (July-June). Most income components were revised up, while some expenditure aggregates were downwardly revised.</p>
<p>&quot;Consequently, household saving which is derived as a balancing item, has been revised up significantly for recent quarters,&quot; the ABS said.</p>
<p>Adjustment to pay-as-you-earn tax collections also affected the December 1995 and March 1996 quarters, the ABS said.</p>
