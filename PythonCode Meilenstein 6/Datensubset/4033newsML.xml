<p>A senior Israeli minister who once likened Arabs to cockroaches in a bottle said on Tuesday it might be better for the Jewish state if the peace process &quot;exploded.&quot;</p>
<p>Agriculture Minister Rafael Eitan, who led Israeli troops as army chief of staff during the 1982 invasion of Lebanon, told Israel's Haaretz newspaper in an interview that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would drag his feet on peace.</p>
<p>&quot;The government will go at the slowest possible pace. It will scrutinize every apostrophe in the agreement before moving forward. The prime minister sees these things correctly when he's not hurrying,&quot; Haaretz quoted Eitan as saying.</p>
<p>Asked if he would be pleased if the peace process &quot;exploded&quot;, Eitan said:</p>
<p>&quot;If it is good for the national interest that everything explodes, let it explode.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In my opinion there is no peace process at all,&quot; Eitan said. &quot;The Arabs don't wan't peace. What the previous government did was to dash for peace without understanding that the question in our region is to be annihilated or to take a stand.&quot;</p>
<p>The 67-year-old former general sits on Netanyahu's &quot;security council&quot; of senior ministers and staunchly opposes Israeli-PLO peace accords signed by the dovish government Netanyahu ousted in May elections.</p>
<p>&quot;These agreements are a severe blow to the national interest. I don't know how we'll get out of this,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Netanyahu, who took power in June, has yet to fulfil an agreement signed between the former government and the Palestine Liberation Organisation that committed Israel to redeploy its troops in the West Bank town of Hebron.</p>
<p>In 1983, an Israeli state commission criticised Eitan for failing to prevent a massacre of Palestinian civilians by Christian Lebanese militiamen at two refugee camps outside Beirut. Israeli troops were stationed not far from the scene of the massacre.</p>
<p>Before retiring from the army in 1983, Eitan told a parliament committee: &quot;When we have settled the land, all the Arabs will be able to do about it will be to scurry around like drugged cockroaches in a bottle.&quot;</p>
