<p>Mother Teresa was conscious and in stable condition in an Indian nursing home on Thursday after suffering heart failure and her condition was being monitored by a team of physicians, a doctor said.</p>
<p>The 85-year-old Roman Catholic missionary who won the Nobel peace prize was admitted to Woodlands Nursing Home in Calcutta on Tuesday with a temperature of 103 degrees Fahrenheit (39.4 degrees Celsius) and severe vomiting.</p>
<p>Dr A.K. Bardhan told Reuters said a team of five doctors was constantly monitoring her condition. &quot;Her condition is same as it was in the morning. She is fully conscious and stable,&quot; he said. The next bulletin on her health would be issued on Friday.</p>
<p>Bardhan described the cardio-respiratory complications as heart failure. He said Mother Teresa, fitted with a heart pacemaker in 1989, had suffered heart failure in the past and responded to treatment.</p>
<p>&quot;Last night she developed some cardio-respiratory complications which were handled and corrected quickly,&quot; he said. She was given anti-heart failure treatment and respiratory support.</p>
<p>Asked to give a prognosis, the doctor said: &quot;It is very difficult to say.&quot; He offered no more details on her condition or the treatment.</p>
<p>A general physician in New Delhi said heart failure could cover a range of problems, but given Mother Teresa's age and the fact she had a pacemaker could indicate a serious condition.</p>
<p>&quot;In the next 24 or 48 hours we will know if she is responding to treatment and will pull out of this,&quot; said the doctor, who asked not to be identified.</p>
<p>A nun at Mother Teresa's religious order, the Missionaries of Charity in Calcutta, said: &quot;We are all praying for her speedy recovery.&quot;</p>
<p>The nun said all of the order's senior nuns were at the nursing home attending Mother Teresa, who many regard as a living saint. She will be 86 next Tuesday.</p>
<p>Mother Teresa, who is of Albanian Descent founded a network of missions for the poor and the sick in Calcutta, India's most densely populated city, in 1949 and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979.</p>
<p>Her health began to deteriorate in 1989 when she was fitted with the pacemaker. In 1991, she was treated at a California hospital for heart disease and bacterial pneumonia.</p>
<p>In May 1993, she fell in Rome, breaking three ribs. In August the same year, while in New Delhi to receive an award, she developed malaria, complicated by her heart and lung problems.</p>
<p>The Missionaries of Charity order now has nearly 3,000 people ministering to the needy, dying and orphaned in the slums of 200 cities.</p>
<p>Its work includes caring for nearly 7,000 children in 120 homes and arranging 1,500 adoptions a year. In 1988, nearly four million sick people were treated at its 629 mobile clinics.</p>
