<title>AUSTRALIA: Budget sets conditions for rate cut - Costello.</title>
<headline>Budget sets conditions for rate cut - Costello.</headline>

<p>Australian Treasurer Peter Costello said on Tuesday that the 1996/97 budget would set the conditions for another interest rate cut as long as it successfully passed through the senate.</p>
<p>He said the budget could be knocked around in the senate, which is currently controlled by left-leaning Green and Democrat senators who have expressed opposition to many budget measures.</p>
<p>&quot;The (Reserve) Bank has made it clear that medium term fiscal consolidation will aid that process,&quot; Costello told a news conference when asked if his 1996/97 budget increased the chance of a rate cut.  </p>
<p>&quot;If we can get a good budget through the senate which addresses Australia's savings problems, we can set up the conditions for that,&quot; he said, referring to a possible rate cut.</p>
<p>Australian officials cut official interest rates by 0.5 percentage points to 7.0 percent on July 31.</p>
<p>Costello said it was possible the budget could remove some measures from the budget, which introduced measures to cut the underlying budget deficit by A$3.9 billion to a forecast A$5.65 billion in 1996/97.</p>
<p>&quot;The senate could knock this budget around, but if it does it's knocking around our future,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>&quot;This is the once in a term, once in a decade opportunity to get it right,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;There are a number of measures, I haven't actually quantified them, which require legislative change that the senate could defeat,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope it doesn't.&quot;</p>
<p>The Australian dollar dropped sharply and other financial markets sold off in 1993 when the Labor government struggled to get some of its budget cutting measures through a hostile senate.</p>
