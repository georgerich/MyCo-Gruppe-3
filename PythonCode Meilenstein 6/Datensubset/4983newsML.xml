<p>A general strike led by Nepal's opposition communists, which brought much of Kathmandu to a halt on Wednesday, ended peacefully, eyewitnesses and officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;Barring a few incidents of throwing stones at transport vehicles, the situation was normal,&quot; Gopendra Bahadur Pandey, spokesman for the Home (Interior) Ministry, said.</p>
<p>The strike was called by the National Mass Movement Coordination Committee (NMMCC) in protest against the ruling centre-right coalition saying it was responsible for corruption, high inflation and unemployment in the Himalayan kingdom.</p>
<p>&quot;The strike passed off peacefully and in an impressive way,&quot; a spokesperson of the communist-led who called the strike, said.</p>
<p>This is the first major political protest against Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba's Nepali Congress-led coalition.</p>
<p>Goverment officials said the strike had a &quot;minor impact&quot; in the city while eye witnesses said most shops in the main shopping area remained closed. Only a few transport vehicles were running.</p>
<p>The communists also criticised Deuba's government for signing in February a treaty with neighbouring India to share waters of the Mahakali river, which they say was not fair to Nepal.</p>
<p>The treaty now awaits a ratification by the Nepali parliament.</p>
<p>The strikers have also accused the government of harassing innocent people and political rivals in western Nepal under the guise of a crackdown on Maoist rebels in an insurgency which has claimed more than 40 lives in the past six months.</p>
<p>The strike, which came a day after the end of a three-month closure by textile mills opposing a rise in sales tax, was the first major showdown with the opposition since the government came to power last September.</p>
<p>The Deuba's coalition assumed power after it dislodged in a confidence vote a communist minority government which had ruled for nine months.</p>
<p>Nepal launched a multi-party democracy under a constitutional monarchy headed by King Birendra in 1990 after bloody pro-democracy demonstrations.</p>
