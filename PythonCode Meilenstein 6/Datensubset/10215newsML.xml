<headline>Blue-chip stocks hit by higher long-term rates.</headline>

<text>
<p>Blue-chip stocks ended lower Friday as a surprisingly strong July durable goods report sent Treasury bond yields soaring to the highest level in more than three weeks.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones industrial average lost 10.73 points to 5,722.74. For the week, it was up 33.29 points.</p>
<p>In the broader market, declining issues led advances 1,266 to 1,001 on moderate volume of 308 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>&quot;Given the fact that bonds plummeted the stock market didn't act too badly,&quot; said Hildegard Zagorski, an analyst at Prudential Securities. &quot;We had a respectable session on very low volume.&quot;</p>
<p>The benchmark 30-year Tresaury bond lost more than 1-1/4 points, raising its yield to 6.95 percent -- the highest since July 31 -- from 6.83 percent at Thursday's close.</p>
<p>Inflation-sensitive bonds were sent reeling by news that July durable goods orders rose 1.6 percent, against expectations for a 0.3 percent rise.</p>
<p>The data, coupled with expectations that job growth jumped in August, re-ignited talk that the Federal Reserve might consider an increase in short-term interest rates at next month's meeting of its policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee.</p>
<p>This week, the Fed opted to keep lending rates unchanged amid signs of a slowing economy and subdued inflation.</p>
<p>The recently favoured interest-rate sensitive financial sector met some brisk selling. Freddie Mac lost 1-7/8 to 90-1/8, Fannie Mae lost 1/2 to 32-1/2, Citicorp was off 7/8 to 86-7/8 and J.P. Morgan was off 1-1/8 to 91-3/8.</p>
<p>Analysts said the broader market was resilient in the face of stiff bond selling.</p>
<p>&quot;If rates can stay beneath 7 percent, the market will survive this mess,&quot; said Ralph Bloch, chief technical analyst at Raymond James. &quot;Anything above 7 percent is a real psychological negative and bonds once again become a viable alternative for money.&quot;</p>
<p>A resumption of more normal trading activity is expected after the Sept. 2 Labour Day holiday when more traders, who delayed earlier summer vacations, return.</p>
<p>The Dow index recovered in late trading following a rebound in the shares of Philip Morris, which ended up 1-1/8 to 88.</p>
<p>The steadiness in tobacco shares came as President Clinton detailed new rules to curb teen smoking by restricting sales and marketing of tobacco. It was the first time tobacco had been subjected to Food and Drug Administration regulation.</p>
<p>Wall Street was also awaiting the outcome of a key tobacco liability case in Indiana. The jury started deliberations Thursday.</p>
<p>Among tobacco shares, RJR Nabisco, parent of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, rose 1/8 to 25-3/8, Loews slipped 3/8 to 74-3/4, and smokeless tobacco maker UST fell 1/4 to 30-1/2.</p>
<p>&quot;Selling in tobacco shares wafted away,&quot; said Marty Kearney, a trader at PTI SEcurities.</p>
<p>Paper and forest products stocks rose after Goldman Sachs raised its opinion of the sector.</p>
<p>Georgia-Pacific rose 1-3/4 to 77-7/8, and Willamette was up 1-3/8 to 65, while Boise Cascade, rose 5/8 to 35.</p>
<p>Among individual stocks, Bay Networks rose 1-7/8 to 27-1/8 and was the most-active NYSE issue on renewed speculation of a possible buyout by Lucent Technologies. Both companies declined comment.</p>
<p>C-Cube climbed 3-3/8 to 33-3/4 on hopes that the maker of semiconductor-based encoders might get some a chunk of Zenith Electronics' $1 billion contract for supplying digital TV set-top boxes to the Americast consortium.</p>
<p>Zenith, which climbed 5-1/2 Thursday on news of the Americast deal, gave back 2 to 14-7/8.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq Composite index lost 0.91 to 1,143.05.</p>
<p>The Standard &amp; Poor's composite index of 500 stocks fell 3.65 to 667.03. The American Stock Exchange index rose 0.62 to 560.94.</p>
<p>The NYSE Composite index of all listed common stocks fell 1.49 to 357.23. The average share was down 17 cents.</p>
<p>The Wilshire Associates Equity Index -- the market value of NYSE, American and Nasdaq issues -- was 6,529.177 down 22.646 or 0.35 percent.</p>
