<p>South African Justice Minister Dullah Omar on Tuesday supported the aims of a Moslem vigilante movement that publicly killed an alleged drug baron, but warned that opposition to crime was not a licence to kill.</p>
<p>&quot;I want to make it very, very clear that those who fight drug trafficking, those who fight gangsterism, are our allies,&quot; he told parliament during an often-heated special debate on the Moslem movement People Against Gangsterism and Drugs (Pagad).</p>
<p>But Omar, himself a Moslem, warned he would not tolerate actions such as the murder of alleged drug baron Rashaad Staggie, co-leader with his twin brother Rashied of the Hard Livings gang.</p>
<p>&quot;Fundamentally, the thousands of people who support Pagad and who have taken part in their campaign and who want to rid our country of drug trafficking are our allies.</p>
<p>&quot;We need to ensure that we fight together with our allies to rid our country of drug-trafficking and gangsterism. This does not mean that we condone people taking the law into their own hands,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Staggie, 40, was shot and burned in front of police and television crews earlier this month. Pagad leader Nadthmie Edries has been charged with sedition related to the killing.</p>
<p>Omar said he would meet Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi and other security chiefs later on Tuesday to draft an anti-crime strategy to go before the cabinet on Wednesday.</p>
<p>He declined to say what measures were being considered, but Mufamadi told parliament he planned separately to invoke special measures including a ban on guns at demonstrations.</p>
<p>Mufamadi said he had ordered an investigation of reports that known gangsters, many with criminal records, owned licensed firearms.</p>
<p>In addition, he said he planned to bring in a specialist unit that successfully reduced the rate of car hijackings around Johannesburg to Cape Town to investigate the government's long-term failure to prosecute gangsters.</p>
<p>The Staggie killing focused the nation's attention on crime by gangs and Pagad has since spawned similar movements in most major cities.</p>
<p>A week after Staggie was killed, police and armed Pagad supporters clashed in Cape Town's mixed-race Athlone district when riot units travelling in armoured trucks halted a march on the homes of alleged drug dealers.</p>
<p>A Moslem taxi driver was killed in what Pagad members believe was a revenge attack by gangs and a Moslem-owned shop was torched.</p>
<p>On Saturday, vigilantes cornered a drug dealer and doused him with petrol. A witness told Reuters the dealer was not set alight only because his Pagad attacker spilled petrol on himself and did not dare to light a match.</p>
