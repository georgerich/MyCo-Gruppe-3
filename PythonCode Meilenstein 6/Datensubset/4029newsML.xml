<title>ISRAEL: Israel shekel rises against dollar, basket.</title>
<headline>Israel shekel rises against dollar, basket.</headline>
<dateline>TEL AVIV 1996-08-20</dateline>

<p>The Israeli shekel gained mildly against the dollar and the basket of foreign currencies in dull trading, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing happens in the market. Activity is extremely low and the shekel was traded in a tight range,&quot; said a dealer at Bank Hapoalim.</p>
<p>&quot;The basket was moving around 6.8-6.9 percent below the slope, but at these rates investors started buying foreign currency,&quot; he said</p>
<p>The shekel can fluctuate in a trading band of 7.0 percent above or below a slope designed to devalue the Israeli currency at six percent a year against the basket of key currencies.</p>
<p>If the shekel-basket exchange rate reaches the lower trading band the market believes the central bank would intervene by buying foreign currency.</p>
<p>The representative rate for the dollar was 3.1480 against 3.1500 on Monday. The basket, composed of the dollar, mark, pound sterling, French franc and yen, closed at 3.5388 shekels against 3.5417 on Monday.</p>
<p>On the crosses the shekel traded against the yen at 2.9164 shekels per 100 yen against 2.9188 on Monday and against the mark at 2.1128 shekels per mark against 2.1152 on Monday.</p>
<p>In late afternoon the dollar was trading at 3.1490 shekels.</p>
