<p>North Korea, seizing on student unrest over reunification in South Korea as a timely propoganda weapon, announced on Thursday that two South Korean students in the communist nation had started an indefinite hunger strike.</p>
<p>The official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), monitored in Tokyo, said the two students vowed to risk their lives unless fellow students detained by South Korean authorities for supporting reunification were released.</p>
<p>KCNA said the hunger strike started on Wednesday night on the North Korean side of the border town of Panmunjom.</p>
<p>It identified the students as Ryu Se Hong and To Jong Hwa, and said they were in North Korea to attend functions there for the reunification of the two Koreas.</p>
<p>About 3,200 students were arrested this week in Seoul after riot police stormed a teaching block at Yonsei University, smashing through burning barricades of desks and chairs and lobbing stun grenades to dislodge mostly female undergraduates.</p>
<p>&quot;The North is taking advantage of this incident to divert the eyes of their people away from its domestic situation and to gain advantage over the South in future negotiations,&quot; said Noriyuki Suzuki, a North Korea analyst at Radio Press in Tokyo.</p>
<p>Since the Yonsei clash, KCNA and other North Korean media have issued a barrage of stories about what they called suppression of human rights by South Korea's &quot;truculent fascists.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They (the two students) vowed to carry on an indefinite hunger strike at the risk of life ... until all of their comrades, who risked their life to make the grand reunification festival successful, are released,&quot; KCNA said.</p>
<p>Suzuki said the uproar in South Korea offered a timely opportunity for North Korea to divert the attention of its people from their own woes of floods and famine.</p>
<p>&quot;The riot incident also gives North Korea an extra card to bring out in future negotiations such as proposed four-nation peace talks,&quot; Suzuki said.</p>
<p>South Korea and the United States have proposed four-nation peace talks with North Korea and China, to replace a truce agreement that ended the 1950-53 Korean War.</p>
<p>North Korea, however, has insisted on bilateral talks with the United States to seek a peace agreement, saying South Korea is not a party to the armistice agreement that ended the Korean War.</p>
<p>Suzuki and other North Korea-watchers doubted if North Korea would use the riots to sever communication channels with the South.</p>
<p>&quot;The North's attack on the South's handling of student gatherings at this time of the year is more or less an annual event and won't last for long,&quot; Suzuki said.</p>
