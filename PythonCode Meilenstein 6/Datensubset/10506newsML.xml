<p>The European Commission and Germany failed on Friday to defuse a row over public aid to carmaker Volkswagen which has spurred anti-European Union sentiment in the bloc's largest member state.</p>
<p>European Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert and German Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt met in Brussels but could agree only to continue their efforts to reach a solution.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think you can say we were able to overcome the problems today,&quot; Van Miert told a news conference, during which both men were obviously wide apart on the issue of aid for Volkswagen to develop plants in the eastern state of Saxony.</p>
<p>Reflecting the controversial nature of the case, Rexrodt said there was a strong possibility that Bonn would decide to challenge the Commission in the European Court of Justice.</p>
<p>Van Miert, who says Saxony has paid illegal aid to Volkswagen, also reiterated his threat to take the case to the Luxembourg-based court.</p>
<p>&quot;Today we can't say we have made enough progress (not to proceed with court action) -- an illegal situation still exists in our view,&quot; Van Miert said.</p>
<p>He added that the Commission would discuss the situation at its first meeting after the summer break on September 4.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Bonn and Brussels would continue their talks.</p>
<p>&quot;We have agreed that in the next few days we shall be trying to come to a pragmatic settlement for the VW case...,&quot; Rexrodt told the same news conference.</p>
<p>The row over public aid to VW erupted last month when Saxony state premier Kurt Biedenkopf overrode Commission objections to the aid package size and paid out extra funds.</p>
<p>Biedenkopf, a Christian Democrat (CDU) ally of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, warned that the state stood to lose thousands of jobs in the towns of Mosel and Chemnitz if it did not pay.</p>
<p>VW had suspended plans to develop plants in the two towns after the EU executive rejected 241 million marks ($161.7 million) of a total promised aid package of some 780 million.</p>
<p>Van Miert reacted furiously to Saxony's defiant move, saying that the decision to pay 91 million marks in unauthorised support to VW could touch off an EU &quot;subsidy war&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;If there were no discipline it would undermine our whole aid policy which would lead to total anarchy,&quot; he told Friday's press conference.</p>
<p>Van Miert has previously threatened to block other aid to Europe's largest carmaker or to exclude it from public tenders. ($ = 1.49 German Marks)</p>
