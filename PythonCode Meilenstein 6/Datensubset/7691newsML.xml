<headline>China says Taiwan shipping rules show trade domestic.</headline>
<dateline>BEIJING 1996-08-22</dateline>

<p>China said on Thursday its rules on direct shipping links with Taiwan show that future trade will be a purely domestic matter.</p>
<p>&quot;The documents define clearly that direct cargo transport between harbours on the Chinese mainland and Taiwan is regarded as domestic transportation under special management,&quot; the official Xinhua news agency said.</p>
<p>The regulations were issued unilaterally by Beijing this week, despite a ban on direct links by Taiwan.</p>
<p>Beijing's new rules specify that only Taiwanese or Chinese companies -- or joint ventures including one side or the other -- would be allowed to conduct business on the routes.</p>
<p>Under the regulations, shipping companies must apply with Chinese authorities although no mention was made of any need to seek approval from Taiwan.</p>
<p>Beijing also called on Taiwan to allow direct air links as well as trade and mail service, all of which are banned by Taipei, according to the news agency.</p>
<p>Taiwan's Nationalist government has banned direct air and shipping links with China since 1949 when Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist troops lost the Chinese civil war to the communists and fled to the island.</p>
<p>China sees the island as a renegade province.</p>
<p>With tensions easing since the late 1980s, civilian aircraft and vessels have skirted the ban by stopping over in a third country or territory such as the British colony of Hong Kong or Portuguese-run Macau.</p>
<p>Taiwanese businessmen, who have poured more than $20 billion into China, are eager for direct transport links, but Taiwanese authorities have been reluctant to lift the ban.</p>
<p>The Nationalists, who say they are committed to eventual reunification with China, see direct transport links as their last bargaining chip in talks with the communists.</p>
