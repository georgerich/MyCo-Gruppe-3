<p>China's cut in interest rates in May has sent securities trading in Beijing soaring, and has slowed the growth in bank savings deposits, the official Xinhua news agency said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The value of securities traded in Beijing in May, when the interest on savings deposits was cut an average 0.98 percentage point, totalled 32.73 billion yuan, more than three times the monthly average for the first four months, it said in a report issued late on Tuesday.</p>
<p>It gave no figures for the following months, but turnover in general has picked up since the interest rate cut.</p>
<p>The rate reduction, along with the ending in April of inflation subsidies paid on bank savings deposits of three years and longer, also has slowed the growth of savings deposits, it quoted the People's Bank of China, as saying.</p>
<p>Personal savings grew by 2.92 billion yuan in May and 2.7 billion yuan in June, compared with the monthly average growth of 5.04 billion yuan for the January-March period and 5.73 billion yuan in April, the central bank said.</p>
<p>Cuts in the lending rates of an average 0.75 percentage point had saved state enterprises in Beijing 1.1 billion yuan in interest rate payments, it quoted a bank official as saying.</p>
