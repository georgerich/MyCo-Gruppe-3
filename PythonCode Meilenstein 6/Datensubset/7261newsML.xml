<p>Commonwealth Bank of Australia said earnings growth recorded across the bank's businesses and an improvement in the cost to income ratio were behind the 13.8 percent rise in net profit to A$1.119 billion for 1995/96.</p>
<p>&quot;During 1995/96, earnings growth was recorded across the bank's businesses, and a key indicator of competitiveness, the cost to income ratio, again improved,&quot; managing director David Murray said in a statement.</p>
<p>Commonwealth Bank said the cost to income ratio fell to 60.6 percent in the year to June 30, 1996, from 62.5 percent a year earlier.  </p>
<p>Murray said assets grew by six percent to A$109 billion in 1995/96. &quot;The bank's asset quality remained striong, with net impaired assets falling by 30 percnet, to less than one percent of net loans and bank acceptances,&quot; Murray said.</p>
<p>He said the charge for bad and doubtful debts fell by 38 percent and remains at cyclically low levels.</p>
<p>&quot;These factors combined to help offset the impact of continuing pressure on margins and other income generation,&quot; Murray said. He added that the bank's share of home loan approvals increased in 1995/96 and that the bank intends on remaining a leading provider of finance to home buyers.  </p>
<p>In June, the Commonwealth cut the home loan variable interest rate by 0.15 percentage points to 9.75 percent.</p>
<p>The bank said its funds management arm, Commonwealth Financial Services, increased net operating profit by 20 percent to A$60 million in 1995/96. Funds under management total A$14.3 billion, making it Australia's second largest retail manager.</p>
<p>It said its New Zealand unit ASB Bank Ltd posted a 10 percent rise in profit to NZ$72 million in 1995/96, due to very strong business growth and continuing market share improvement.</p>
<p>Net profits from its Australian banking operations rose to A$1,012 million in 1995/96 from A$882 million a year ago.  </p>
<p>At 10.25 a.m. (0025 GMT), Commonwealth shares were seven cents up at A$11.12.</p>
