<p>Portuguese shares closed higher amid strong activity in bank Banco de Fomento e Exterior and construction firm Somague. Dealers expected 'blue chips' such as BFE, Cimpor, Portucel and PT to be the most active stocks tomorrow.</p>
<p>* PSI-20 index up 7.19 points to 4,640.33</p>
<p>* BFE, which the government is in the process of privatising, said net profit surged nearly 150 percent in the first half of the year. But the profit surge to 16.2 billion escudos ($106.2 million), from 6.59 billion over the same period last year, was entirely due to windfall gains from the sale of its stake in state investment management group IPE-Investimentos e Participacoes Empresariais.</p>
<p>* The second phase of the privatisation of BFE does not appear on the agenda for Thursday's cabinet meeting, a government spokesman said. But the fact that the issue was not included on the formal agenda did not mean that it would not be discussed, he added.</p>
<p>* The reduction in pulp stocks and an expected increase in consumption should boost white eucalyptus pulp prices this year and in 1997, the president of Portuguese pulp group Portucel Industrial, Jorge Godinho, said. &quot;We expect the prices of pulp and paper to continue to rise until the end of 1996 and this should continue in 1997,&quot; Godinho told Reuters.</p>
<p>* An investment fund bought just over 3.6 percent of Portuguese construction firm Somague-SGPS in pre-trade on Lisbon bourse, a company spokesman said. Somague closed at 1,095 esc, down five, in volume of 503,500 shares.</p>
