<p>Japan, once a laggard in satellite launching, has shot into the front ranks of space with its H2 rocket's latest success challenging Chinese and European dominance in the field.</p>
<p>The H2's success last Saturday in lifting two satellites into orbit, followed three days later by a Chinese rocket's failure in a similar mission, leaves Japan poised to land a billion dollar contract from Hughes Electronics Corp to launch a dozen satellites.</p>
<p>Two months ago, the European Space Agency's (ESA) Ariane 5 rocket blew up on its maiden flight, effectively ruling it out as a contender for the Hughes contract.</p>
<p>Rocket System Corp, a consortium of 74 Japanese high-tech firms, announced last month it had reached a &quot;basic agreement&quot; with Hughes to launch the 12 satellites using an advanced model of the H2 rocket.</p>
<p>And after Saturday's success, Japanese officials are now confident the &quot;basic agreement&quot; is about to become reality.</p>
<p>&quot;We will announce details of the deal with Hughes once the main contract has been signed, probably in a month or so,&quot; a spokesman for Rocket System told Reuters on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Japanese media said the Hughes deal, at about 8.5 billion yen ($78.7 million) per launch, would firmly place Japan in the global satellite launching business, until now dominated by Europe's Ariane rockets and China's Long March rockets.</p>
<p>If the contract is signed, Japan could be launching the first of Hughes' satellites in 2001.</p>
<p>Hughes is a wholly owned subsidiary of General Motors Inc and Rocket System is led by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd and Nissan Motor Co.</p>
<p>Last Saturday, the indigenously developed H2 rocket lifted two satellites into orbit, with one at 3.6 tonnes, the largest satellite released into orbit by Japan.</p>
<p>It was the fourth successful H2 lift-off -- there has not been a failure since the first launch in 1994 - and the first billed as a &quot;commercial&quot; and not experimental launch.</p>
<p>Japan's government-funded National Space Development Agency (NASDA) owns the rocket but Rocket System Corp is in charge of selling the rocket to commercial clients.</p>
<p>The Advanced Earth Observation Satellite (ADEOS) successfully placed in orbit on Saturday is for use by environmental scientists in the United States, Europe and Japan.</p>
<p>For NASDA and Rocket System, the four H2 successes neatly pointed up their rocket's reliability against recent failures by the Chinese and European launchers.</p>
<p>The European Space Agency (ESA) suffered a major setback last June when its latest model, the Ariane 5, blew up less than one minute after lift-off on its maiden flight.</p>
<p>The ESA admitted that the explosion was caused by faulty software and inadequate simulation experiments.</p>
<p>One month later, in a sign of how the satellite launching world has changed, the ESA asked Japan's NASDA to launch an experimental communications satellite for it using the first advanced model of the H2, called the H2A.</p>
<p>The ESA's Artemis satellite will be launched in 2000 free of cost, although NASDA would be given rights to 200 hours worth of experimental communications using the Artemis.</p>
<p>&quot;The failure of Ariane-5 and the Artemis plea to Japan were not directly linked,&quot; said Akira Kubozono, a former top NASDA official.</p>
<p>&quot;It's just that the H2 rocket came as a heaven-sent gift for the ESA's satellite division looking for a free lift-off,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In China's case, there have been two failed launches by its Long March-3 rockets this year, one in February which killed six people on the ground and another one just on Tuesday when it failed to place a domestic communications satellite into orbit.</p>
<p>Japan's H2 rocket was once the butt of jokes for its hugely expensive launch costs. At 18.5 billion yen ($171 million), it was double the bill for a U.S. or European launcher and more than four times that of China's.</p>
<p>Rocket System hopes to halve the H2 costs mainly by buying foreign parts, mass-producing components, doing away with expensive weldings and improving engine performance. ($1=108 yen)</p>
