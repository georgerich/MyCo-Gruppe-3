<p>The Federal Reserve is waiting too long to start raising interest rates, according to a Georgia State University forecast that predicts a recession could threaten the U.S. economy by 1998.</p>
<p>The quarterly outlook released Thursday by the university's Economic Forecasting Center said inflationary pressures have begun to build in the labor markets while sensitive industrial prices have changed direction and trended upward over the last six weeks.</p>
<p>&quot;The Federal Reserve already should have used preventive restraint to overcome inflation before it rises enough to threaten the expansion,&quot; center director Donald Ratajczak said.</p>
<p>The report forecasts a modest increase in short-term interest rates in 1996 and again in early 1997, pushing the prime rate to 8.75 percent by spring. The rate hikes should help contain inflation, but grocery prices were projected to rise 4.8 percent in 1997, contributing to acceleration in the consumer price index from a 2.8 percent gain in 1995 to a 3.4 percent gain in 1997, the study said.</p>
<p>The forecast assumed current economic policies would continue during the next two years.</p>
<p>&quot;If fully implemented, the Dole economic program is expected to raise interest rates, raise inflation and raise the deficit while having only minor effects upon economic growth,&quot; Ratajczak said. &quot;Cutting taxes and, therefore, raising government debt before cutting the budget is responsible for this outcome.&quot;</p>
<p>The forecast said continuation of Clinton policies will create more government and slightly less growth but that inflation, interest rates and the deficit will be lower than under the Dole proposals.</p>
<p>On average, consumers are not overextended because their net worth has increased nearly 20 percent in the past year. But consumer debt has increased seven percent while income has only grown five percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Therefore, the 60 percent of households that do not have significant direct holdings in financial assets may be overextended,&quot; Ratajczak said.</p>
<p>That will help push 1996 personal bankruptcy filings to one million, though reduced stigma and abuse of the bankrputcy code will also contribute.</p>
<p>The report said the economy should continue to expand at moderate rates through 1997. But reduced consumer spending, slowing of capital spending and the topping out of an inventory building that has just started could threaten recession in 1998.</p>
<p>&quot;This is especially true if the Federal Reserve delays too long in restraining industrial inflation and allows price speculation again to influence economic decisions,&quot; Ratajczak said.</p>
<p>The forecast said stock prices would slow their gain in 1997 because of reduced profit growth and interest rate concerns, while recessionary fears will restrain equity values later in 1997.</p>
