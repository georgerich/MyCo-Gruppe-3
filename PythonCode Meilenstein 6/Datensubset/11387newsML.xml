<p>Investigators have found microscopic traces of an an explosive substance on debris from downed TWA Flight 800 but have no evidence to prove that a bomb caused the plane to crash, the top FBI investigator in the case said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Based upon evidence to date, investigators cannot conclude whether this tragedy was the result of a criminal act,&quot; James Kallstrom, assistant FBI director, said at a media briefing. &quot;The mere fact that there are chemical traces is just not enough.&quot;  </p>
<p>Kallstrom said the explosive traces were &quot;of unknown origin.&quot; Investigators had told The New York Times and other newspapers earlier that traces of PETN, a chemical used in plastic explosives, were found on a piece of one of the plane's passenger seats.</p>
<p>The Paris-bound Boeing 747 exploded and crashed into the Atlantic Ocean on July 17 just minutes after taking off from Kennedy International Airport. All 230 people on board were killed.</p>
<p>Kallstrom said evidence so far did not prove or discount any of investigators' three leading theories -- that a bomb, a missile or mechanical failure caused the jet to crash.</p>
<p>&quot;Other things like scarring or pinging (on the plane's wreckage) would be the type of things we would be looking for,&quot; Kallstrom said. &quot;We don't have the preponderance, the critical mass of information that tells us what happened.&quot;</p>
