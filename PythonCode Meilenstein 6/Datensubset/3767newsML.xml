<headline>U.S. bulk millfeeds - Buyer interest building.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1996-08-20</dateline>
<text>
<p>U.S. millfeeds traded at steady to higher prices at several locations and many dealers reported gradually increasing buyer interest, particularly for October to December positions.</p>
<p>New-crop corn from the Southeast and from south Texas has not yet pressured millfeed values, because millfeed supplies remain tight, dealers said. Many flour mills were holding firm on offers because much of their production has been sold.</p>
<p>Increased buyer interest for October-December positions was reported, which dealers said was normal as feed mixers start booking winter needs.  </p>
<p>&quot;The calendar is telling people to start buying the O-N-D,&quot; said one dealer, referring to the October-December delivery period.</p>
<p>Flour mills, however, have much of their millfeed production sold for that time frame and are holding firm on offers, dealers said.</p>
