<title>NETHERLANDS: FORECAST - Dutch Boskalis H1 net seen lower.</title>
<headline>FORECAST - Dutch Boskalis H1 net seen lower.</headline>
<dateline>AMSTERDAM 1996-08-20</dateline>

<p>Dutch analysts are agreed dredger Boskalis will post a fall in first-half net profits on Friday, but vary widely in their estimates of how big the earnings slide will be.</p>
<p>Profit estimates range from 18.3 million guilders to 37.3 million, with the consensus at 30.1 million guilders. Last year the world's biggest dredging company posted first-half profits of 41.4 million guilders.</p>
<p>&quot;First-half results will clearly come in lower than last year, but the question is how much lower,&quot; ING Barings' Paul Verbraeken said.</p>
<p>&quot;Boskalis described capacity utilisation in the first half as 'moderate' and it depends how you interpret that,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Verbraeken is forecasting first-half net of 36 million guilders or 1.39 guilders per share, a fall of 14 percent year-on-year.</p>
<p>Earnings would be supported by the acquisition of dredging firm De Holland and Boskalis' doubling of its stake in Finnish Terramare OY to 80 percent earlier this year, Verbraeken said.</p>
<p>&quot;They're small, but every bit helps,&quot; he said. Verbraeken conceded he was &quot;less negative than the market&quot; on Boskalis, whose order books were well-filled.</p>
<p>By contrast Bank Labouchere's Sven Smit was extremely bearish on the dredger's first-half outlook, predicting net profit of 18.3 million guilders or 72 cents per share.</p>
<p>&quot;There will undoubtedly be a major profit fall,&quot; he said. The protracted winter in Europe and a lack of major orders to compensate for the completion of lucrative projects in Hong Kong would drag down earnings, he said.</p>
<p>Longer term, however, the dredging market was seen picking up slightly although margins were at structurally lower levels, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The outlook for 1997 and 1998 is better,&quot; Smit said.</p>
<p>Deutsche Bank's Konrad Zomer is forecasting net of 32 million guilders, based on expectations of &quot;reasonable&quot; capacity utilisation generated in part by maintenance work.</p>
<p>&quot;The firm will almost certainly post lower profits year-on-year, but it is difficult to gauge whether some orders were undertaken just in profit or at a marginal loss,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The first half would have been difficult, but Boskalis' order portfolio -- pegged at just over one billion guilders in March -- was developing well, he added.</p>
<p>For the full year Zomer is forecasting net earnings of 2.60 guilders per share versus 2.79 in 1995.</p>
<p>But he added that in 1997 Boskalis' share of an 800 million guilder order to expand Singapore's Chiangi airport would work through into profits.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is heading for an upturn in 1997,&quot; Zomer said, adding the increase in demand would likely be enough to absorb a 15 percent rise in capacity as three new jumbo suction hopper dredgers are taken into service late this year and early next.</p>
