<title>UK: FORECAST - Steam to fog up Rolls H1 profits.</title>
<headline>FORECAST - Steam to fog up Rolls H1 profits.</headline>

<p>Rolls-Royce Plc is likely to show a hefty first-half pretax loss of 149 to 175 million stg when it reports next Thursday, because it wants to draw a line under problems with its lossmaking steam power generation business.</p>
<p>Rolls announced a month ago that it wanted to dispose of the Parsons and Combustion International steam power generation businesses which together lost 11 miliion stg in 1995 on 280 million stg of sales.  </p>
<p>It would therefore be making provisions in its first half results of 100 million stg to run off existing contracts and a further 70 million stg contingency charge to cover asset write-downs or closure costs, should it fail to find a sale or joint venture for the businesses.</p>
<p>In addition Rolls said goodwill of 78 million stg would be written off through the profit and loss account.</p>
<p>But the company has already hinted that the red in the pretax headline figure will be softened by news of a further climb in underlying profits as the core aero-engines business shows better operating margins after years of rationalisation.  </p>
<p>Increased military work and a rising civil order book should also help, as indicated in a brief trading statement last month which said &quot;results for the aerospace group are expected to demonstrate continuing improvement&quot; over first half 1995.</p>
<p>Analysts are therefore expecting the company to report underlying pre-exceptional profits of anywhere between 73 and 99 million stg, up from 54 million stg last time.</p>
<p>&quot;I am sure they will find some good things to say at the results and whatever the (profit) number is it's going to be a lot higher than last time at the pre-exceptional level,&quot; said aerospace analyst Nick Cunningham of BZW.  </p>
<p>However, he still believes too much is already expected of Rolls' share price, which was up a further 7p at 226p on Friday.</p>
<p>He sees the firm having its work cut out not to disappoint the market over the longer term despite strong indications that the aircraft manufacturing business cycle is now on the upturn.</p>
<p>&quot;The current price discounts that not just good earnings growth but fantastic earnings growth is sustained,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Current forecasts by analysts are for Rolls to make pre-tax profits before exceptionals of around 220 million stg this year and 279 million stg in 1997, with prospective pre-exceptional earnings of 12 pence a share this year and 14.3 pence in 1997.</p>
