<p>European plane maker Airbus Industrie on Friday savoured its latest order at the world's biggest airline, United Airlines, stealing a march on rival Boeing Co and putting it ahead in net market share.</p>
<p>The UAL Corp unit said on Thursday it was ordering 24 Airbus A319 aircraft valued at $900 million, making it the first U.S. airline to order the A319, Airbus' latest model.</p>
<p>&quot;It's an important order because we are winning a repeat order in what was seen as Boeing's home market,&quot; an Airbus spokesman said by telephone from Toulouse, France, headquarters.</p>
<p>Airbus first won a United Airlines order in August 1992 when it sold the A320.</p>
<p>&quot;The order for the A319 means that they are coming back because they were pleased with the performance of the A320,&quot; the spokesman said, noting negotiations had been very tough.</p>
<p>But he dismissed talk of extreme price concessions. &quot;Clearly a big customer can get a bigger concession than a small customer, but Airbus never sells at a loss,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Airbus Industrie now claims it is ahead of Boeing in the market segment for planes of 100 seats and more. On reported orders, however, Boeing still has the upper hand.</p>
<p>&quot;Boeing has recently had a number of transformation orders which effectively are cancellations of a previous order but Boeing counts it as a new order. If you substract these then we are ahead,&quot; the Airbus spokesman said.</p>
<p>Deliveries of the UAL planes are scheduled to begin in June 1997 and end by mid-1999. The A319s will be used to replace older Boeing Co 737-200s in United's fleet.</p>
<p>The new planes will be powered by International Aero Engines V2500 engines and configured to seat 126 passengers, eight in first class and 118 in economy, they said.</p>
<p>International Aeroengines is a five-firm joint venture led by Britain's Rolls-Royce Plc and Pratt and Whitney of United Technologies Corp</p>
<p>The A319 is a smaller derivative of the Airbus A320. United already operates a fleet of 34 A320s and will take delivery of 16 more by the end of 1998, they said. United joins Deutsche Lufthansa AG as the largest airline customers for the A320 family, each with 74 planes.</p>
<p>The A319 program was launched in 1993 and has earned 120 firm orders, the companies said.</p>
<p>A UAL spokesman said United chose the Airbus planes over competing Boeing 737-700s and 737-300s after evaluating both.</p>
<p>The next main battle field for plane orders is in India where Boeing, Airbus and McDonnell Douglas Corp on August 14 made their final presentations to the Air India board. A decision on the $2 billion deal is expected by end-September.</p>
<p>Air India wants 20 medium-capacity long-range aircraft. Airbus is pitting its A340 range against Boeing's 777 and McDonnell's MD-11.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a very good time to buy planes,&quot; the Airbus spokesman said about the Air India decision.</p>
<p>&quot;The plane manufacturing industry is coming out of a two to three year through and prices are still low. There have been some big orders recently and prices are set to rise,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Airbus Industrie is a consortium made up of French state-owned Societe Nationale Industrielle Aerospatiale, British Aerospace Plc, Daimler-Benz Aerospace, a unit of Germany's Daimler-Benz AG and Construcciones Aeronauticas SA (CASA) of Spain.</p>
<p>Aerospatiale and Deutsche Airbus have 38 pct each. British Aerospace has 20 pct and state-owned CASA has four pct.</p>
