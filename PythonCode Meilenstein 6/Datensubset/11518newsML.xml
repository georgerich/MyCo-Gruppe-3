<p>Mother Teresa's heart weakened on Friday and she was found to have malaria as authorities expressed concern about the Nobel Peace Prize winner's deteriorating health.</p>
<p>&quot;We are now worried,&quot; said an official at the hospital where the 85-year-old Roman Catholic missionary has been under treatment since Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Her cardiac status is unstable and is closely monitored by a team of doctors,&quot; said Dr A.K. Bardhan, one of a team of physicians treating the Albanian-born missionary, regarded by many as a living saint for her devotion to the poor.</p>
<p>Bardhan said a parasite, P. vivax, which causes malaria, had been found in her blood. Mother Teresa suffered from malaria in 1993.</p>
<p>An official at Woodlands Nursing Home, a hospital in the eastern Indian city of Calcutta where the nun has been under treatment since Tuesday, said &quot;her condition has deteriorated since the morning&quot;.</p>
<p>Bardhan said Mother Teresa, who turns 86 next Tuesday, was conscious but under sedative and speaking only rarely. She remained on a respirator in intensive care, he said.</p>
<p>Mother Teresa was admitted to Woodlands on Tuesday with a temperature of 103 Fahrenheit (39.4 Celsius) and severe vomiting.</p>
<p>She developed heart problems on Wednesday, but had responded to treatment and was in stable condition until Friday morning. While the vomiting had stopped, Mother Teresa continued to run a fever on Friday, Bardhan said.</p>
<p>A five-member team of specialists was formed on Thursday to monitor Mother Teresa's condition. An Indian heart specialist, Dr J.C. Ghosh, was added to the team on Friday, Bardhan said.</p>
<p>Dozens of nuns gathered in Calcutta for round-the-clock prayers for Mother Teresa's recovery.</p>
<p>&quot;Please pray for the Mother,&quot; was written on a blackboard outside the main prayer hall of the Missionaries of Charity, Mother Teresa's 47-year-old religious order which is housed in a sprawling complex in the heart of India's most teeming city.</p>
<p>Wearing white gowns, members of the order knelt on the floor, offering silent prayers for Mother Teresa, one of the world's most widely recognisable figures.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a special prayer. We have been having it in groups since yesterday,&quot; Sister Christene told Reuters.</p>
<p>A large group of nuns gathered outside the chamber of Sister Priscilla, a senior member of the order who was in touch with hospital officials. &quot;She has been handling queries from abroad the whole morning,&quot; an assistant said.</p>
<p>A group of slum dwellers gathered at the gates for news about Mother Teresa.</p>
<p>Known as the Saint of the Gutters, Mother Teresa won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979 for her work with the world's destitute.</p>
<p>In 1949 she founded a network of missions for the poor and the sick in Calcutta. Now, the Missionaries of Charity order has nearly 3,000 people ministering to the needy, dying and orphaned in the slums of 200 cities.</p>
<p>Mother Teresa's health began to deteriorate in 1989 when she was fitted with a pacemaker. In 1991, she was treated at a California hospital for heart disease and bacterial pneumonia.</p>
