<title>UK: Russian debt prices buoyed by IMF agreement.</title>
<headline>Russian debt prices buoyed by IMF agreement.</headline>

<p>Russian debt prices climbed on Thursday after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved the release of delayed money for Russia and bargain-hunting set in following recent weakness, traders said.</p>
<p>Russian MinFins were under pressure on Wednesday after market rumours - swiftly denied - of defaults.</p>
<p>&quot;There has been some bargain hunting in the MinFins and Vnesh after their weakness,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>Jerome Booth, ANZ Grindlays head of emerging markets research, said the IMF loan disbursement and Russia's negative inflation in August were key price supports.</p>
<p>&quot;In addition to the IMF disbursment, inflation in the week to August 19 was negative, that is very impressive,&quot; said Booth.</p>
<p>Russian consumer prices fell 0.1 percent in the week to August 19.</p>
<p>Russian MinFin3 on Thursday were trading up at 75.500/76.500 while MinFin4 were up 0.250 at 48.125/48.625. Dollar-denominated Vnesh paper was up 0.250 at 59.875/60.250.</p>
<p>Traders said bargain hunting on Thursday and support from the IMF approval helped boost prices. The IMF on Wednesday released the July tranche of a $10.2 billion loan which had been frozen because of poor tax collection.</p>
<p>In other debt markets, prices were mostly steady on Thursday as investors waited for the New York market's opening for further direction.</p>
<p>Latin American paper continued to be underpinned by strong economic figures, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;We remain very bullish on Mexico Pars. It is only a matter of time until the market goes up. We have to wait for US retail investors to come back from their holidays,&quot; added Booth.</p>
<p>Mexican Pars were trading at 67.375/67.625 on Thursday while Mexican Discs were trading at 80.500/80.875.</p>
<p>Traders said the movement in yields on the U.S. long bond will set the tone for Brady prices this afternoon.</p>
<p>&quot;They (yields) slipped half a point on Wednesday and put pressure on the market in general. If the yield remains unchanged the market should remain flat,&quot; said a trader.</p>
