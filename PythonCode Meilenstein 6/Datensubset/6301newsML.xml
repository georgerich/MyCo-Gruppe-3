<p>Israel asked Washington on Wednesday to pass a message to Syria that it wanted peace and was ready without preconditions to begin negotiations.</p>
<p>&quot;The message that we sent to (Syrian President Hafez al-) Assad is that Israel is ready at any time without preconditions to enter peace negotiations,&quot; Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy told Israel Radio in an interview.</p>
<p>Levy, who said he gave the message to U.S. Ambassador Martin Indyk, blasted Syrian rhetoric that he said was raising tensions. Levy said Israel expected Syria to prove it wanted peace by answering Israel's call for talks.</p>
<p>&quot;The voices coming out of Damascus are bad, not good. The media...are full of expressions and declarations that must be worrying...this artificial atmosphere is very dangerous because those who spread it could become its prisoners,&quot; Levy said.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect from Syria, if its face is to peace, that it will answer Israel's message to enter peace negotiations because that is our goal,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not want a war, God forbid. No one benefits from wars. In the end they pay a very heavy price and in the end they sit to talk. We must talk and prevent the heavy price that no one should pay.&quot;</p>
<p>Levy, asked if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's statements on a tour of a Lebanon occupation zone earlier this week had not also contributed to tensions, said they were &quot;not a threat in any way certainly to Syria.&quot;</p>
<p>A senior Israeli legislator said on Wednesday that Israeli intelligence agencies were increasingly concerned that Syria may opt for war to break a deadlock in peace talks.</p>
<p>Levy also criticised Syria for its rejection of an Israeli proposal to withdraw from its south Lebanon occupation zone. Syria, main power broker in Lebanon, views the proposal as an Israel ploy to avoid returning the Golan Heights, captured from Syria in 1967.</p>
<p>He said Syria thought &quot;that we in essence by a ploy are trying to escape negotiations with it for peace. That is not Israel's intention. We want, side by side, to talk on two tracks which are one in our eyes.&quot;</p>
<p>Tension has mounted since Netanyahu took office in June vowing to retain the strategic heights. Israeli-Syrian peace talks have been deadlocked over the Golan since 1991 despite the previous government's willingness to make Golan concessions.</p>
<p>Legislator Hagai Merom, chairman of parliament's Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee under the last Labour-led government, said he could not accept Netanyahu's attempts to play down recent tensions with Syria.</p>
<p>&quot;I have heard recently that all Israeli intelligence elements are very carefully examining Syria through a magnifying glass and listening to every noise sounded there,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;From the way things look and sound, the possibility that a war option is being considered (by Syria) as realistic has deepened.&quot;</p>
<p>In an interview with Israeli Army Radio, Merom said: &quot;Assessments are growing within Military Intelligence that there is a possibility of war with Syria.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We must not wake up one morning to a new Yom Kippur,&quot; Merom said, referring to surprise Egyptian and Syrian attacks that began the 1973 Middle East war on the Jewish Day of Atonement.</p>
<p>Syria's Prime Minister Mahmoud Zu'bi ended on Tuesday a four-day visit to Iran during which he met President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, who said the two countries must strengthen ties to face the United States and Israel.</p>
<p>Syria accused Israel on Wednesday of launching a hysterical campaign against it after Israeli Channel Two television reported on Monday that Damascus had recently test fired a Scud C missile able to hit most cities in the Jewish state.</p>
<p>Israel on Tuesday tested its U.S.-funded Arrow 2 missile, saying it successfully intercepted a target missile.</p>
<p>Netanyahu said Syria had been arming itself for years with Scuds and there was no change in the strategic balance, which military analysts consider to be in Israel's favour.</p>
<p>Syria on Tuesday accused Israel of beating the drums of war in the Middle East and warned Netanyahu that he would be defeated in any military confrontation with Arabs.</p>
