<p>As the shackles of interest rate worries dropped from financial markets, London shares leapt through 3,900 for the first time on Friday morning with scarcely a backward glance.</p>
<p>But as the next big target - 4,000 - for the FTSE 100 index of Britain's leading companies comes into view, UK market strategists are questioning whether the surge is sustainable.</p>
<p>The gains of the past month have certainly been dramatic - a near 300 point rise since July 16 and a rebound from the year's low to its high within the space of five weeks.  </p>
<p>The latest push to shares came yesterday from interest rate cuts across Europe in the wake of an easing in monetary policy by Germany's Bundesbank. The move followed a stream of welcome data for markets through August which have cooled fears about overheating economies and inflation in both the UK and U.S.</p>
<p>Even after August's rise, valuations on the stock market are not stretched say strategists, but identifying the factors that might provide the impetus to continue the rally is difficult.  </p>
<p>&quot;It's not that far away but I would be moderately surprised to see 4,000 in the ultra short term. The market has rallied very quickly from the sell-off in the early part of July when Wall Street was under pressure,&quot; said UBS strategist Tim Brown.</p>
<p>Another quick surge forward is unlikely, particularly with the prospect of downbeat comments and disappointing results from the looming manufacturing sector's results season, says Brown.</p>
<p>And uncertainty about U.S. and UK interest rates, the fast approaching general election and November budget are all likely to play a part in capping the soaring stock market.  </p>
<p>The gains in the market this week - new highs on five out of six days - came as markets took heart from the larger than expected German rate cut and the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to leave rates there unchanged.</p>
<p>But it's difficult to see interest rates driving shares much further, says Brown, and another cut in UK rates - normally taken as good news - may not please markets this time.</p>
<p>&quot;There's sufficient uncertainty between the view of the politicians and the Bank of England - and quite a few economists - that the market will see it as a worrying sign because of the risk of overheating,&quot; said Brown.  </p>
<p>Yet the recent rally in the bond market has helped provide leeway for August's advance in share prices.</p>
<p>&quot;Whenever equities have tried to rally in the past it's been constrained by tight domestic valuations relative to gilts. This expensive to gilts',&quot; said BZW strategist Steve Wright.</p>
<p>A lessening in the flow of new issues, privatisations and rights issues, switching into cyclical stocks and continuing bid speculation have provided other boosts.  </p>
<p>&quot;We could see the market move a little forward but we have a year-end target of 3,750 and if the market were to get to 4,000 it would probably be an ideal selling opportunity,&quot; said Wright.</p>
<p>The long holiday weekend period in the UK gives investors a chance to catch their breath and a period of consolidation is likely. UK economic and company news is thin on the ground next week and attention is set to shift back to the U.S.</p>
<p>But with institutional cash holdings relatively high, pressure to put money back into the market may yet provide further fuel to the rally.  </p>
<p>&quot;There's quite a lot of cash out there and quite a lot of people will be nervous,&quot; said SBC Warburg strategist George Hodgson. &quot;All the data through August has been one way...and the turnaround in interest rate sentiment, if it's sustained, will add to that pressure (to put money into market).&quot;</p>
