<p>Short-term trading rates on Zimbabwe's money market were quoted largely softer on Friday following a drop in the benchmark treasury bill rate at Thursday's weekly auction, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said a two-percent drop in the central Reserve Bank rediscount rate, its landing rate to commercial banks, had also contributed towards a fall in other rates.</p>
<p>&quot;The rediscount rate obviously had to come down because other rates were coming down. But I believe it's still too high considering other rates are now in their lower twenties,&quot; one dealer commented.</p>
<p>On Friday, discount houses were buying treasury bills from the central bank at 23.12 percent, down from 23.73 percent last week, and selling them on the market at around 22.5 percent.</p>
<p>NCD bills maturing after 30, 60 and 90 days were being bought at a steady 24.5 percent and sold at 23.5 while bankers acceptance bills were buying softer at 23.75 from 24 percent but selling unchanged at 23.5 percent.</p>
<p>Call money rates slipped to a 22 and 22.75 percentage range from between 23 and 23.5 percent in a market which opened in surplus of Z$148 million, up from Z$78 million on Thursday morning.</p>
