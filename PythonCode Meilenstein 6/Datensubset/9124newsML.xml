<p>Russian security supremo Alexander Lebed flew into a Chechen village for talks with rebel leaders on Thursday hours after the passing of a deadline set by army generals for an assault on the capital, Grozny.</p>
<p>Pounded by Russian forces on Wednesday, Grozny was relatively peaceful early on Thursday morning with no sign of major military activity.</p>
<p>Lebed said he had halted the attack after 11th-hour talks with rebel leaders on Wednesday night. But the field commanders have had clear differences with President Boris Yeltsin's security adviser as well as with their own defence minister.</p>
<p>Explosions occasionally echoed across the countryside around Grozny, but they were far fewer than on Wednesday, when a sporadic air and artillery bombardment went on for hours.</p>
<p>Itar-Tass news agency said six Russian servicemen had been killed in the city overnight, but no casualty figures were available for the rebels who control most of the town or for the civilians cowering in cellars to escape the fighting.</p>
<p>The Red Cross estimated on Wednesday that about 120,000 were left in Grozny. A similar number had fled in the last two weeks.</p>
<p>Presidential aides said Yeltsin, target of speculation over his health as factions vie for position over Chechnya, returned to the Kremlin on Thursday after a brief break.</p>
<p>Lebed returned to the same village where he had talks the previous night and promised to try to end the conflict and agree the status of demilitarised city for Grozny.</p>
<p>&quot;We will today try to stop the war,&quot; he said on arrival at Novye Atagi, some 20 km (12 miles) south of Grozny.</p>
<p>&quot;We have gathered here with the firm intention of achieving something worthwhile. We are going to discuss the issues of how to separate the troops and give Grozny the status of a demilitarised city.&quot;</p>
<p>Lebed said on Wednesday he had agreed a ceasefire with rebel chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov and that the Russian military would not carry out its threat to flatten Grozny with air raids and artillery assaults.</p>
<p>He described the military ultimatum as a &quot;bad joke&quot;.</p>
<p>The Russian military, humiliated by the separatists' takeover of Grozny on August 6, had accused them of using a previous ceasefire to strengthen positions. Military commanders had given civilians 48 hours to leave the city before they began bombing the rebels out of it.</p>
<p>But Lebed assured Maskhadov late on Wednesday there would be no bombing. &quot;I have taken it upon myself never again to give the Chechen side ultimatums,&quot; said Lebed, telling local people who gathered around that he would strive to justify their trust.</p>
<p>Ceasefires have come and gone in 20 months of war in Chechnya, however. With Russia's chain of command looking more than usually tangled in recent days, it may be some time before Grozny can be sure that Lebed is as good as his word.</p>
<p>Asked about his tug-of-war with the generals, Lebed was quoted as saying on Wednesday: &quot;No one has given anyone any powers. You simply have to take it, as I am quietly doing.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to restore a single command structure.&quot;</p>
<p>Frightened civilians have already fled the city, much of it still in ruins after Russian raids at the start of Russia's military campaign to crush Chechnya's independence bid.</p>
<p>Those still in the city, huddled in cellars without power, water or food, have appealed to the outside world for help.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, as commander-in-chief of Russia's armed forces, is in overall command of the Chechnya campaign, Moscow's biggest military engagement since the Afghan war.</p>
<p>But at his only public appearance in seven weeks, his August 9 inauguration, he looked stiff and tired. Aides say he is resting and have denied reports he has suffered a recurrence of heart trouble.</p>
<p>U.S. President Bill Clinton appealed to Yeltsin on Wednesday to end violence in Chechnya and promote a peaceful dialogue.</p>
<p>&quot;This cycle of violence must come to an end because prolonged fighting is only going to endanger civilians,&quot; White House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters, quoting a letter from Clinton to Yeltsin.</p>
