<p>Alexander Lebed, President Boris Yeltsin's personal envoy to Chechnya, arrived in the region for talks with Russian military and Chechen separatist rebel leaders on Wednesday and said he had come &quot;with peace&quot;, Interfax news agency said.</p>
<p>Lebed, whose visit comes just hours before the Russian army has threatened to bombard the rebel-held capital Grozny, met army commander General Vyacheslav Tikhomirov at the Khankala base near Grozny and said he would also meet separatist leader Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev and rebel chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov.  </p>
<p>It was Lebed's third trip to Chechnya since being named by Yeltsin 10 days ago after the military were humiliated by the rebel seizure of Grozny on August 6. He was expected to meet Yandarbiyev near Novye Atagi, 20 km (12 miles) south of Grozny.</p>
<p>Lebed has spoken out against bombing the city. The Security Council, of which he is secretary, issued a statement on Tuesday which queried the authenticity of Yeltsin's order, published on Monday, which instructed Lebed to restore order in Grozny and which, Lebed said, allowed the army to issue its threat.</p>
<p>Defence Minister Igor Rodionov, named last month at Lebed's insistence, on Wednesday disowned the ultimatum issued on Monday by Tikhomirov's deputy saying that the city would be bombed from Thursday morning.</p>
<p>Tikhomirov returned from holiday on Tuesday. He said on Wednesday that he favoured the &quot;most decisive measures&quot; to drive out the separatists.</p>
