<p>Precious metals prices eased back on Wednesday afternoon in the absence of follow-through buying since silver rallied earlier in the week, dealers said.</p>
<p>Bullion fixed lower at $386.80 an ounce, compared to $387.45 in the morning and $387.10 on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p>Bids were quoted so far between $387.85 and $386.50.</p>
<p>&quot;We saw gold firm up a bit on back of the Monday rally in silver, but everyone is looking for follow through. There's a danger it could drift back to where it started,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>Comex December gold was down $0.70 at $392.20 compared to Tuesday's New York close.  </p>
<p>Analysts said gold needed to get past resistance at $390 to make further gains, although producer selling at that level was expected to make progress difficult.</p>
<p>&quot;(Gold) may this week re-try $388-$390. There's resistance there but maybe not as much as people think. We've already been there recently,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>Silver, considered the leader the complex since soaring in New York on chart-driven buying, was still consolidating its gains in a narrow range for the second day running.</p>
<p>It was indicated was a shade lower at $5.19/$5.21, down three cents from Tuesday's London close.  </p>
<p>&quot;The market is very slow. Everyone's waiting for some reason to do something,&quot; a dealer said. Some said they were looking for silver to go as high as $5.30, possibly this week.</p>
<p>But silver may need gold's support to successfully pierce key resistance around $5.25, analysts said.</p>
<p>In that case, upside targets would be at $5.30, then $5.42, levels at which layers of selling were likely to emerge.</p>
<p>Otherwise, silver should find support at previous resistance around $5.15-$5.16, the level which had largely capped its range in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Bids were quoted so far between $5.23 and $5.18.  </p>
<p>Platinum also eased a bit to $398.50/$399.50, down $0.80 from Monday's London close, amid a lack of interest.</p>
<p>Its sister metal palladium, which has edged up slightly since hitting 2-1/2 year earlier this week, was indicated at $125.00/$126.00, down $0.10. But its potential for further gains was also hampered by the summer lull.</p>
<p>&quot;Palladium has bounced off lows and found its bottom, so now people are bargain hunting and covering shorts. But there's no sign of an influx of industrial buying yet,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
