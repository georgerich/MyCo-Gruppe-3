<headline>Thai interbank rate down, baht weaker late.</headline>

<p>The Thai overnight interbank rate continued to ease to 9.50 percent in late trade on Tuesday from 10.50 percent early and 11.00 percent late on Monday on higher money supply, dealers said.</p>
<p>Dealers said market liquidity continued to improve today as most banks seemed to have sufficient funds for the coming reserve requirement and most mid-month value added tax payments had already been made.</p>
<p>&quot;The decline in swap interest rates also prompted some banks to bring in cheap offshore funds,&quot; said one dealer at a foreign bank.  </p>
<p>Commercial banks have to meet Bank of Thailand reserve requirements on the seventh and 22nd of every month.</p>
<p>The baht was lower at 25.278-25.283 to the dollar in late quiet trade compared with 25.275-25.280 earlier as most players awaited the outcome of the U.S. Federal Reserve meeting to be held today, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The dollar/baht trade was quiet ahead of the Fed meeting,&quot; said one currency dealer.</p>
<p>The one-month swap premium fell to 7.50/8.00 satangs late from 8.50/9.50 in the morning and 10.50/10.80 late on Monday, dealers said.  </p>
<p>&quot;The swap premium fell as the confidence of the baht continued to strengthen after the central bank's remark on the weekend,&quot; the dealer said.</p>
<p>Bank of Thailand governor Rerngchai Marakanond on the weekend warned against speculating on the baht and vowed to intervene to defend the currency if necessary.</p>
<p>The mid-rate was fixed at 25.29 to the dollar, unchanged from Monday.</p>
