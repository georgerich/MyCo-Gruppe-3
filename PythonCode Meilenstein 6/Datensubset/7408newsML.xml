<p>Strong buying in shipping stocks pushed Taiwan share prices to a sharply higher close on Wednesday, one day after China issued rules governing direct shipping links with the island.</p>
<p>The weighted index shot up 120.34 points or 1.99 percent to finish at 6,177.78. Turnover was T$42.4 billion.  </p>
<p>Recent official comments that the island's economic policy toward China would not change also boosted buying in firms with mainland investments, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Sentiment was very bullish today but players should bear in mind that the government won't allow investments in mainland China without restrictions and direct shipping links will still take time,&quot; said Albert Lin of Golden Securities.</p>
<p>China said on Tuesday regulations on direct shipping links were effective immediately. But Taipei, saying Beijing's rules were &quot;belated&quot; and &quot;mingled with sensitive political issues,&quot; still bans direct shipping links across the Taiwan Strait.  </p>
<p>Yang Ming Marine soared T$1.8 to T$37.8 after the company signed a joint slot exchange agreement with China's China Ocean Shipping Global Co. The pact allows Yang Ming to cover trade between North Europe and Japan, China and Asia.</p>
<p>President Enterprises, Taiwan's biggest China investor, rose T$1.3 to 40.1. Formosa Plastics Group member Nan Ya, which said it would halt plans for a US$3 billion China power plant amid recent political uncertainties, gained T$1.9 to T$51.5.</p>
<p>&quot;Recent good news on Taiwan-China economic ties should support the market in the near term,&quot; said Mike Tsai of Grand Cathay Securities.  </p>
<p>Despite the overall optimism, brokers noted the possibility of profit-taking from gains since Tuesday.</p>
<p>They said market focus would remain on China-concept shares as well as shipping issues in the near term.</p>
<p>Initial resistance was seen above 6,200 points while support was at 6,100.</p>
