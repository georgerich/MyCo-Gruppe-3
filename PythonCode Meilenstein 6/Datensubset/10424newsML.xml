<p>French shares opened slightly higher on Friday after a big gain on Thursday on the back of surprise interest rate cuts in Germany and France, dealers said.</p>
<p>Shares were supported by a firmer Wall Street, bonds and franc but dealers said they expected resistance for the August CAC-40 future at 2,035.</p>
<p>The blue-chip CAC-40 index was up 3.76 points or 0.19 percent at 2,021.52 at 0817 GMT while the CAC-40 futures contract was up at 2,025.5 from 2,025 on Thursday's close.</p>
<p>&quot;If the U.S. market will rise further today we could hold, otherwise we rise to see some declines due to profit-taking,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>Volume was limited at 300 million francs.</p>
<p>Trade might become more lively this afternoon with U.S. July durable goods orders due at 1230 GMT.</p>
<p>Promodes was up 3.39 percent at 1,280 francs after the Les Echos newspaper reported the retailer could sell as soon as on Tuesday its German assets to Spar AG. A Promodes spokesman said the German dossier would be closed in early September or October. First half results are due on September 10.</p>
