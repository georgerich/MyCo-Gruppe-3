<p>French doctors said on Wednesday that the first African taken to hospital after fasting along with nine other immigrants for 47 days to fight an expulsion order was in no danger.</p>
<p>Moussa Keita, a Malian man among 10 hunger strikers who are backed by 300 protesters occupying a Paris church, was driven away in an ambulance on Tuesday night, severely drained by his fast and complaining of pains in his stomach.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no diagnosis yet because tests have to be carried out. But the doctor at the (Lariboisiere) hospital told us that he was not in danger,&quot; Michel Brugiere, of the medical charity Medecins du Monde, told Europe 1 radio.</p>
<p>Doctors however expressed concern that two of the other nine fasters at the Saint-Bernard church were in serious condition as the hunger strike entered its 48th day.</p>
<p>The hunger strikers have been drinking sugared tea and eating vitamins.</p>
<p>Several human rights associations and trade unions have called a march through Paris to the church for Wednesday afternoon to show support for the protest.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Alain Juppe, cutting short a holiday, returned to the capital on Tuesday as the stand-off took an increasingly political turn, with senior politicians urging an apparently inflexible government to compromise.</p>
<p>He met Gilles de Robien of the centre-right UDF, junior coalition partner, who broke with the official line by meeting representatives of the protesters and suggesting negotiations with the government and deputies of all parties.</p>
<p>The protesters, who include 110 children, are surrounded by hundreds of sympathisers committed to preventing police seizing them.</p>
