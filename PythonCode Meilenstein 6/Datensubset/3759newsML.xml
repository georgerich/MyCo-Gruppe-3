<p>The U.S. Defence Department said it would begin destroying chemical weapons on Thursday at its Toole facility in Utah as its first domestic step toward destroying the entire U.S. chemical arsenal by 2004.</p>
<p>It said last week the first weapons to be destroyed at Toole would be M-55 rockets filled with nerve gas.</p>
<p>U.S. chemical weapons were already being destroyed at an installation on the Johnston Atoll in the Pacific. Toole was to be the first of eight locations in the United States that would destroy them.</p>
<p>The United States pledged not to use chemical weapons and must by law destroy its entire arsenal of 3.6 million chemical weapons by 2004. Toole was holding more than 44 percent of the U.S. stockpile of 30,000 tons of chemical weaponry.</p>
<p>The Defence Department announced last week the Toole destruction would begin this week after a U.S. district judge rejected an effort to block it.</p>
<p>It said U.S. District Judge Tena Campbell denied in Salt Lake City on Wednesday a preliminary injunction in a lawsuit brought by private groups led by the Kentucky-based Chemical Weapons Working Group.</p>
<p>It said the judge ruled the groups did not show that the incineration of the weapons would put people around the Toole Chemical Agent Disposal Facility at risk.</p>
<p>It said she wrote that &quot;for individuals living closest to TOCDF, the risks resulting from continued storage are 100 times greater than the risks resulting from disposal operations.&quot;</p>
