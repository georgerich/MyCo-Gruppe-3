<p>Australian government comments that the defection of a Labor opposition politician may boost its chances for selling part of telecoms carrier Telstra Corp may be wrong, a key independent politician said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe they're barking up the wrong tree,&quot; independent senator Brian Harradine told Australian Broadcasting Corp radio.  </p>
<p>Labor Senator Mal Colston quit the party earlier this week and is now no longer bound by party policy, sitting as an independent until his term expires in 1999.</p>
<p>The conservative Liberal-National government has said this increases its chances of pushing key reforms through the Senate, where it does not have a majority and needs the support of at least two non-government senators.</p>
<p>Finance Minister John Fahey said on Thursday Colston's move could allow the government to succeed in getting Senate approval to its plans to sell one-third of Telstra.  </p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps the events in the Senate this week in terms of one particular Labor member may assist ultimately that going through,&quot; he told a business breakfast in Sydney.</p>
<p>The Labor opposition and other minor parties in have pledged to vote against the Telstra sale in the Senate.</p>
<p>Harradine said he still had several concerns about the planned partial privatisation, which would raise an estimated A$8 billion.</p>
<p>&quot;There may be other ways of getting the money out of Telstra,&quot; he said, adding he was awaiting the finding of a Senate committee inquiry into the sale, due to report soon.  </p>
