<title>NETHERLANDS: Analysts see improvement for Pakhoed.</title>

<p>Analysts were mostly confident that Pakhoed will post healthy second-half 1996 profits and achieve growth in 1997 after restructuring charges hit first-half 1996 profits published on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;We are considering upgrading our forecasts for the whole year and also for 1997,&quot; said Corne Zandbergen, analyst at Generale Bank.</p>
<p>Pakhoed's first-half net earnings were more or less unchanged from 1995 after stripping out a 15 million guilder write-down on tank storage assets and a gain of about seven million from preferential tax treatment, analysts said.</p>
<p>Analysts point to improvements in chemical storage performance and the conclusion of a substantial long-term contract in Singapore as promising for future growth.</p>
<p>&quot;These are certainly positive indicators,&quot; said Pieter van Gelder, transport analyst at Delta Lloyd Bank.</p>
<p>Zandbergen said Pakhoed's shedding of its Furness port services unit and its acquisition of chemical distribution firm Univar represented a rational repositioning.</p>
<p>&quot;We are pleased they have decided to shed Furness.. and the acquisition of Univar leaves them much more in line with their core activities,&quot; Zandbergen said.</p>
<p>However, some analysts raised doubts over Pakhoed's purchase of Univar for 521 million guilders, questioning the financing of the operation and expecting additional costs.</p>
<p>&quot;Pakhoed want to finalise the acquisition in the second half, but it doesn't include every part of it. Maintenance costs will have a negative effect and the total cost could easily be well be over 521 million,&quot; said van Gelder.</p>
