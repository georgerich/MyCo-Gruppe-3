<p>The Sudanese opposition in exile said on Thursday that the Sudanese authorities executed 11 military officers this week on charges of taking part in an alleged conspiracy to attack government targets in Port Sudan.</p>
<p>Mohammed al-Mutasim Hakim, spokesman for the opposition Democratic Unionist Party in Cairo, said in a statement that the officers were shot by firing squad on Sunday. He named five of them -- two lieutenant-colonels and three majors.</p>
<p>Sudanese officials in Khartoum were not immediately available to comment on the report.</p>
<p>Sudanese government papers have said the authorities arrested 19 civilians and an unstated number of soldiers in connection with the alleged conspiracy.</p>
<p>Armed forces spokesman Lieutenant General Mohamed Sanousi Ahmad said the plan was to attack vital installations in Port Sudan and disrupt the country's foreign trade.</p>
<p>Red Sea governor Badawi al-Khair told the official news agency SUNA on Thursday that the conspirators also planned to assassinate prominent people and use Port Sudan as a base from which to take over other parts of the country.</p>
<p>But Hakim said the authorities fabricated the conspiracy story to cover up a purge of army officers hostile to the Islamist government of President Omar Hassan al-Bashir.</p>
<p>&quot;Since the military coup of June 30, 1989, the government has announced more than 50 coup attempts but it has not tried anyone and it has not proved the charges against those it has arrested,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>&quot;The authorities in Khartoum announce imaginary coups to purge political and military rivals and to intimidate the Sudanese public, which rejects their policies,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Hakim said the executions on Sunday took place under the supervision of Lieutenant-Colonel Ibrahim Shams al-Din, one of President Bashir's security advisers.</p>
<p>&quot;The government insisted on rushing the executions without a fair trial or allowing the officers the right to defend themselves or charges backed by documents,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Hakim said 56 civilians and military personnel remained in detention in Port Sudan in connection with the alleged plot and their lives were in danger because of torture.</p>
<p>The officers executed were Lieutenant-Colonel Ali Abbas Ali, Lieutenant-Colonel Mohammed Mahmoud, Major Salah Kandous, Major Salah al-Dardiri and Major Tajessirr Sarbil, he said.</p>
<p>Ali, Kandous and Dardiri were from the Air Defence Corps based in Port Sudan and the other two were from the navy.</p>
