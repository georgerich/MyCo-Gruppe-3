<p>Indonesian benchmark SIR20 offer prices were flat in late trading on Wednesday as the market gave a mixed reaction to reports of a planned sale of the United States natural rubber surplus, dealers said.</p>
<p>Dealers said SIR20 offer prices for September/October deliveries remained at 55.00-55.25 U.S. cents/lb fob Medan, 54.50-55.00 cents fob Palembang, Surabaya as well as Padang, and at 53.75-54.24 cents fob Jambi and Pontianak.</p>
<p>Some dealers in Padang and Medan said the reports were likely to impact negatively on Indonesian rubber, but some Jakarta-based dealers said they were unlikely to have any impact.  </p>
<p>U.S. Defense National Stockpile Center planned to start selling up to 60,000 tonnes of surplus natural rubber, both ribbed smoked sheets and technically specified blocks early next year.</p>
<p>It is definitely not a good news for rubber traders in Padang. Unlike in Medan and Palembang, dealers in Padang export almost all of their rubber to the United States, one Padang dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are still waiting for the details, but it is likely to be business as usual. The market has become accustomed to such reports,&quot; one Jakarta-based dealer said.</p>
<p>Dealers said SIR20 was last traded late on Tuesday at 55.00 cents/lb fob Medan October deliveries.  </p>
<p>Dealers said high amoniac grade latex was on offer at 2,325-2,350 rupiah/kg in Bandung and Tangerang against the previous 2,425 rupiah/kg.</p>
