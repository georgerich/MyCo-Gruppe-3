<headline>U.S. judge delays decision on Lloyd's until Friday.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-08-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>A U.S. district judge has decided to delay until Friday a decision on a lawsuit filed by a group of U.S. investors seeking to block a Lloyd's of London recovery plan, the court said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Judge Robert Payne had been expected to issue his ruling this afternoon at the court in Richmond, Va.</p>
<p>&quot;There will be no decision issued today,&quot; an assistant to Payne said. A decision is now expected Friday afternoon.</p>
<p>The investors, known as names, are seeking an injunction to block the plan, which is designed to keep Lloyd's solvent.  </p>
<p>Payne declined comment on the reason for the delay in his ruling.</p>
<p>Under its recovery plan, Lloyd's plans to reinsure billions of pounds of liabilities into a new company, Equitas. It is asking names to help pay for Equitas, but offered them 3.2 billion stg to offset this cost and end litigation.</p>
<p>Lloyd's has moved to have the U.S. lawsuit dismissed, arguing that the U.S. names are bound to conduct legal action against the insurance market in Britain.</p>
<p>The names argue that Lloyd's sold them a security, bringing them under the protection of U.S. securities laws.  </p>
<p>Lloyd's has set an August 28 deadline for names to accept or reject its recovery plan.</p>
