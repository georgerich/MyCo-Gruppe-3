<p>U.S. traders said the American Depositary Receipt market for Mexican issues was not affected by a protest outside the Mexican stock exchange that delayed the start of floor trading.</p>
<p>Traders said the demonstration by high school students and their parents over school placements was not a major concern, especially when compared to the recent strength of Mexican stocks and falling interest rates.</p>
<p>&quot;We've got some great data from Mexico on the economic side,&quot; an ADR trader said. &quot;There's some significant interest now that Mexico is back is on track.&quot;</p>
<p>On the bolsa, traders said there was little to no trading going on and no prices had been released so far this morning. It was impossible to tell how the issues underlying ADRs were performing.</p>
<p>Mexican ADRs this morning were mixed. Telmex, the benchmark of the Mexican stock exchange, rose 1/2 to 33-7/8.</p>
