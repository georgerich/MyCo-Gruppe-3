<p>Russian troops started intensive heavy artillery attacks on Wednesday against rebel positions in the Chechen capital Grozny, setting parts of the city on fire, Itar-Tass news agency said.</p>
<p>&quot;The federal forces are using self-propelled guns, firing more than 10 times a minute. As a result of the shooting, parts of the town are covered in smoke and flames,&quot; it said, quoting its correspondent in Grozny.  </p>
<p>Tass said its correspondent Boris Kipkeyev, speaking by telephone from Russia's military base in Khankala airport east of Grozny, reported that the main opposition was around Minutka square and a bridge over the Sundzha river in the centre.</p>
<p>The 101st brigade of interior ministry troops was destroying rebel positions and snipers, it said.</p>
<p>Russian security supremo Alexander Lebed was due to fly to Grozny later on Wednesday to try to defuse a crisis caused by threats by the Russian military to bomb the city if the rebels, who captured much of it on August 6, did not withdraw.</p>
