<title>UK: Silver hits two-month peak, gold edges higher.</title>
<headline>Silver hits two-month peak, gold edges higher.</headline>

<p>Silver prices were at their highest levels since mid-June on Tuesday after speculative buying sent the New York market surging overnight, dealers said.</p>
<p>Gold followed only reluctantly, but market analysts said it could eventually make a go of breaking through its recent price ceiling at just under $390 an ounce.</p>
<p>Silver was indicated at $5.20 an ounce, up eight cents from Monday's London close and its highest price since June 19.</p>
<p>It eased a bit as dealers took their profits in early European business after reaching a peak of $5.26 overnight.</p>
<p>But several dealers said they saw it venturing higher later this week.</p>
<p>&quot;There has seen some good hedge-fund buying of silver call options, and also the underlying (silver metal) recently,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>Options are popular with market speculators as they offer a cheap way into betting on price movements.</p>
<p>An option gives its owner the right but not the obligation to buy or sell a commodity at a set price at some specified future date.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a purely technical move, but I can see it going for $5.30 this week,&quot; the dealer added.</p>
<p>Technical analysts or chartists who follow detailed charts of past prices noted that the rally could run into selling at silver's 200-day moving average price of $5.33 per ounce.</p>
<p>In contrast, bullion fixed at just $387.10 an ounce, versus $386.40 on Monday afternoon and $386.25 in the morning.</p>
<p>&quot;Gold has had a bit of a dismal performance. The move seems to be just in silver,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>But some chartists said gold has scope to move higher.</p>
<p>&quot;Obviously much depends on gold's ability to clear the critical resistance immediately below $390,&quot; said analyst Elli Gifford of Investment Research of Cambridge.</p>
<p>&quot;But silver's recovery following what is looking to be a false breakdown earlier below $5.00 adds to the evidence this may occur,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>Some analysts said gold was being cautious ahead of the U.S. Federal Open market Committee (FOMC) meeting in New York later on Tuesday in case of surprises regarding interest rates.</p>
<p>Another dampener was a slump in the South African rand.</p>
<p>&quot;There's been some (South African gold) producer selling with the weaker rand,&quot; a dealer said, referring to the currency's overnight slump to 4.59 to the U.S. dollar.</p>
<p>Palladium was slightly firmer, up $0.60 at $124.65 and off recent 2-1/2 year lows. But dealers were disappointed palladium had not absorbed more strength from silver.</p>
<p>The same was true for platinum, which was up just $1.10 at $399.50, dealers said.</p>
