<p>Algerian security forces killed five Moslem rebels on Sunday night near Algiers and one person was wounded when a bomb exploded on Monday in a coffee shop in the northeastern town of Tizi-Ouzou, Algerian newspapers said.</p>
<p>The newspaper Liberte said the five rebels were killed at Sidi el Kebir, near the capital, and security forces seized weapons.</p>
<p>Le Matin said the coffee shop bomb was the second attack on a coffee shop in central Tizi-Ouzou, 90 km (55 miles) from Algiers.</p>
<p>A rash of bomb attacks against restaurants and coffee shops in Algiers and other towns in July killed more than 20 people, according to Algerian reports.</p>
<p>The government-appointed watchdog body, Human Rights National Observatory (ONDH), was quoted on Monday by el Watan newspaper as saying about 1,400 civilians have been killed in the past two years in bomb attacks, including booby-trapped cars, blamed on Moslem guerrillas.</p>
<p>An estimated 50,000 people, mostly Moslem militants and security forces members, have been killed in Algeria's violence since early 1992 when authorities cancelled a general election in which radical Islamists had taken a commanding lead.</p>
