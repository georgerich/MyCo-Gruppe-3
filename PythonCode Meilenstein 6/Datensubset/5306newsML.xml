<p>NOTE -- AB Volvo is a Swedish vehicle manufacturer.</p>
<p>A Reuters poll of 10 analysts found the market was expecting Volvo to post a pre-tax profit excluding one-off items of 3.37 billion crowns for the first half of 1996. Forecasts for non-recurring items varied between 300 and 583 million crowns.</p>
<p>-- Stockholm newsroom +46-8-7001017 STOsaveq  </p>
<p>&quot;Net interest income of 633 million crowns and gains of 453 million crowns on the sale of shares contributed to net earnings on a level with first half 1995 results,&quot; the company said in a statement.</p>
<p>Volvo said its drive to concentrate on automotive operations, that began in 1994, had been virtually completed.</p>
<p>But it said income for vehicle operations was substantailly lower than in 1995 first half due to product and market development costs, the introduction of new products, and declining markets and profitability for Volvo Trucks in north and south America.</p>
<p>Volvo reported sales of 78.06 billion crowns for the first half compared to 85.13 billion a year earlier.</p>
<p>It said Volvo Car had returned to the black in the second quarter of 1996, aided by cost cutting, after making losses in the two previous quarters even though sales were seven percent lower than a year ago.</p>
<p>The car unit reported an operating profit of 187 million crowns against 1.58 million a year ago on sales of 39.83 billion crowns.</p>
<p>&quot;Demand for the Volvo S40/V40 models is strong,&quot; the company's chief executive Soren Gyll said in the report.</p>
<p>He said the problems with long delivery times were gradually improving and the new small models were not expected to have an impact on earnings until the second half of the year.</p>
