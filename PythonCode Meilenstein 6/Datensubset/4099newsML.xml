<headline>White House hints at welfare bill signing Thursday.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1996-08-20</dateline>

<p>White House spokesman Mike McCurry hinted on Tuesday that President Clinton will sign sweeping welfare reform legislation into law on Thursday.</p>
<p>Asked when the president would sign the bill, McCurry told reporters, &quot;I expect by the end of the week but not Friday and not Wednesday.&quot;</p>
<p>Clinton was scheduled to sign two other major pieces of legislation this week: a bill to raise the minimum wage on Tuesday and health insurance reform on Wednesday.</p>
<p>He announced July 31 that he would sign the welfare bill, which would end the 61-year-old federal guarantee of aid to the poor and delegate broad power to states to design their own welfare programmes.</p>
<p>He said he would sign it despite its &quot;serious flaws&quot; because it &quot;gives us a chance we haven't had before to break the cycle of dependency&quot; that plagues millions of Americans. He also promised to seek new legislation to remedy what he sees as its principal defects.</p>
<p>Some of his longtime supporters sharply criticised his decision, arguing that the bill would hurt children and throw hundreds of thousands into poverty. Many analysts viewed his decision to sign it as the latest in a series of moves toward the political centre before the Nov. 5 presidential election.</p>
