<p>A senior German diplomat visited Moscow on Wednesday to press home Bonn's growing alarm about the situation in breakaway Chechnya and urge Russia to halt its military campaign there, the German foreign ministry said.</p>
<p>German politicians from across the political spectrum called on Russian President Boris Yeltsin to halt the bloodshed.</p>
<p>Opposition parties demanded Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Yeltsin's closest Western ally, use his influence with his friend to help end the fighting.</p>
<p>Wolfgang Ischinger, the foreign ministry's political director, made clear to Russian government officials Bonn's desire for a peaceful settlement in Chechnya under the aegis of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).</p>
<p>&quot;In his talks in Moscow, the political director stressed our great concern about current developments,&quot; a ministry statement said.</p>
<p>&quot;He stressed the necessity of a peaceful solution that involves the OSCE and underscored our call to refrain from further military action.&quot;</p>
<p>Ischinger insisted in talks with Russia's National Security Council that security chief Alexander Lebed quickly hold talks with the leader of the OSCE mission in Chechnya. Ischinger was told the request would be passed on to Lebed immediately.</p>
<p>The OSCE mission has withdrawn from the Chechen capital of Grozny in the light of Russian forces' threat on Monday to bomb Grozny if rebels, who captured most of the city on August 6, did not withdraw.</p>
<p>&quot;We expressly urge President Yeltsin to forbid the big offensive in Chechnya announced by Russian forces and do his utmost... so that the bloodshed will end,&quot; said Rudolf Seiters, deputy parliamentary leader of Kohl's Christian Democrats.</p>
<p>Kohl said in a television interview at the weekend that he had repeatedly raised the issue of human rights abuses in Chechnya with Yeltsin and that he would call the Russian leader again once Kohl returned from his summer holiday in Austria.</p>
<p>Rudolf Scharping, parliamentary leader of the opposition Social Democrats, said this was not enough.</p>
<p>&quot;This may be too late, above all for the people of Grozny. The chancellor has to act now,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He criticised Yeltsin for breaking his campaign promise to end the war and seek a peaceful settlement with rebels, adding: &quot;You do not reach a political settlement with artillery shellings and bombardments. This is naked terror.&quot;</p>
