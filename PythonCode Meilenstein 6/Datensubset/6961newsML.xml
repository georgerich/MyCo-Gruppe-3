<headline>Calif. Senate panel backs revisions to quake plan.</headline>
<dateline>SACRAMENTO, California 1996-08-20</dateline>
<text>
<p>A key state panel approved new revisions on Tuesday to the proposed $10.5 billion California Earthquake Authority.</p>
<p>The California state Senate Judiciary Committee approved the revisions by a vote of 6-to-1, sending the bill to the full Senate for consideration. The Senate was expected to take up the bill later this week.</p>
<p>Senate President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer, D-Hayward, said his revisions would make the authority more consumer friendly.</p>
<p>Lockyer said the bill provides more equitable rates for the San Francisco Bay area. It also requires the insurance industry to retain its $3 billion contingent liability for 12 years.</p>
<p>In July, the proposed earthquake authority could only muster 21 votes in the state Senate, six short of what was needed to pass the legislation.</p>
<p>&quot;We're pleased that progress has been made,&quot; said Richard Wiebe, deputy state insurance commissioner.</p>
<p>The authority was proposed as part of a plan to help solve the state's homeowners insurance crisis.</p>
