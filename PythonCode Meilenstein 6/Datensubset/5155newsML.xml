<p>Higher oil prices have helped Kuwait lower its government budget deficit but structural changes to the economy are needed to cut the shortfall further, the country's largest commercial bank said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Oil prices for the remainder of 1996 are expected to remain above the $13 a barrel projected in the budget and government spending will remain fairly stable, National Bank of Kuwait (NBK) added in a quarterly economic review.</p>
<p>&quot;The windfall gains should help lower the budget deficit below one billion dinars ($3.3 billion),&quot; the bank said, referring to the fiscal year 1995/96 that ended on June 30.</p>
<p>But it added: &quot;Serious measures to tackle the deficit remain a necessity.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It would be quite risky if the current fortuitous drop in the deficit were to give the government a false sense of comfort and reduce the sense of urgency for introducing structural changes outlined in the five year plan for eliminating the deficit by the year 2000.&quot;</p>
<p>Planning officials have said Kuwait should consider raising revenue by imposing tax for the first time on Kuwaiti companies, hiking petrol prices, imposing duties on luxuries, cutting subsidies on public utilities and pursuing privatisation.</p>
<p>Some of these measures are mentioned in a five year plant to eliminate the shortfall by the end of the century.</p>
<p>The government projected a gap for 1995/96 of 1.32 billion dinars or 16 percent of national wealth as measured by gross domestic product (GDP), on spending of 4.23 billion dinars.</p>
<p>But Finance Minister Minister Nasser al-Rodhan said earlier this year he estimated the 1995/96 deficit could turn out as low as 500 million dinars due to lower than expected state spending and higher than expected oil prices.</p>
<p>Recent budgets have been based on an oil price of $13 a barrel for Kuwait's kind of crude, but for most of the past 18 months the price has been $15 or above.</p>
<p>The firm prices helped Kuwait, which runs one of the world's most lavish welfare states, raise GDP by eight percent and gross national product by 13 percent in 1995. Kuwait covers the gap from state investment reserves already heavily depleted by 1991 Gulf War payments.</p>
