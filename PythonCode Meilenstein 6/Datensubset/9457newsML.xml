<title>TURKEY: Fighting rages in Turkey's Kurd rebel conflict.</title>
<headline>Fighting rages in Turkey's Kurd rebel conflict.</headline>
<dateline>ANKARA 1996-08-22</dateline>

<p>Fighting between Turkish forces and Kurdish rebels raged and the two sides issued widely differing death tolls on Thursday for recent clashes.</p>
<p>The state-run Anatolian news agency said 37 people, mostly Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) guerrillas, were killed in fighting in the southeast of the country.</p>
<p>But a Kurdish news agency close to the rebels gave a higher toll and said most dead were members of the security forces.</p>
<p>Anatolian said Turkish troops had killed 32 guerrillas in separate clashes in Hakkari, Sirnak and Siirt provinces. It gave no details of military casualties or when the clashes took place. Security officials in the southeastern city of Diyarbakir were not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>The rebels killed five people, including three pro-government village guards, in a rocket attack on Wednesday night near the rugged border with Iraq, Anatolian said.</p>
<p>The Kurdish news agency DEM said the guerrillas had killed 47 Turkish troops in the last three days in the southeast. It said only one rebel had died.</p>
<p>More than 20,000 people have been killed in the 12-year-old conflict between security forces and the PKK, fighting for Kurdish autonomy or independence.</p>
<p>A leading official in Turkey's coalition called parliament to an extraordinary meeting to discuss ending nine years of emergency rule in 10 mainly Kurdish southeastern provinces.</p>
<p>&quot;Drafts on lifting emergency rule...will be discussed at the meeting,&quot; Anatolian quoted True Path Party (DYP) deputy Saffet Arikan Beduk as saying. He said deputies from the DYP and its coalition partner Welfare Party had agreed to call a meeting on August 27 or September 3.</p>
<p>Islamist Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan has vowed to scrap emergency rule under his plan to solve the Kurdish problem through &quot;Moslem brotherhood&quot;.</p>
<p>An Iraqi Kurdish rebel group meanwhile urged the West to halt what it said was Iranian military support for a rival militia in fighting between northern Iraq's Kurds.</p>
<p>The Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) says Iranian artillery has bombarded its positions this week in an enclave protected from Baghdad by a Western allied air force known as Operation Provide Comfort (OPC).</p>
<p>&quot;The OPC member countries are directly responsible for bringing the situation under control,&quot; KDP Ankara representative Safeen Dizayee told Reuters. &quot;We want direct measures to be taken if need be.&quot;</p>
<p>But a rival Kurdish group denied KDP charges that Iran was lending it support in fighting that broke out at the weekend and shattered a U.S.-brokered ceasefire announced last year.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a desperate attempt to confuse the facts of the situation,&quot; the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) said.</p>
<p>U.S., British and French planes based in south Turkey have been shielding Iraq's Kurds from any attack by Iraqi government forces since shortly after the end of the 1991 Gulf War.</p>
<p>But the air force did not stop Iranian troops from entering the enclave last month to chase Iranian Kurdish rebels.</p>
<p>The KDP, led by Massoud Barzani, said on Wednesday that Iranian artillery killed or wounded about 100 people in daily bombardments of northern Iraq this week in support of the PUK.</p>
<p>Barzani's group said in a later statement that Iran had helped thousands of PUK fighters to pass through its territory on Wednesday in a bid to attack the KDP from the rear.</p>
<p>Washington on Wednesday urged the rival parties to stop fighting and accept a U.S. invitation to peace talks in London.</p>
<p>Northern Iraq has been split into rival Kurdish zones since fighting broke out between the two groups in 1994. Around 3,000 people died until the ceasefire last March.</p>
