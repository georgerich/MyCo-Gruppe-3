<p>The stock listing of Bakun Hydro-Electric Corp Bhd on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange has been postponed to late December or early January, The Star newspaper reported on Friday.</p>
<p>Bakun is the developer and operator of the controversial $5.4 billion Bakun hydroelectric dam, to be built in the East Malaysian state of Sarawak.</p>
<p>The Star quoted Ekran Bhd executive chairman Ting Pek Khiing as saying that Bakun's four billion shares would be traded by early January. Officials at Ekran could not immediately be reached for further comment on Friday.</p>
<p>Original plans had called for the Bakun listing to be in April or May this year at an offer price of 1.80 ringgit a share. The public offering would be the biggest ever on the Kuala Lumpur exchange.</p>
<p>Ekran and the state government of Sarawak, which is on Borneo island, own 51 percent of the Bakun company.</p>
