<p>A grand jury has returned a two-count indictment charging Pitt-Des Moines Inc with violating federal safety regulations in a 1993 building collapse that killed two workers, prosecutors said Thursday.</p>
<p>If convicted of the misdemeanor charges, the Pittsburgh-based construction firm faces a maximum fine of $500,000 on each count, U.S. Attorney James Burns of the Northern District of Illinois announced.</p>
<p>Pitt-Des Moines's general counsel Thomas Lloyd said the company would not comment on the latest charges until it received a formal notice of the indictment.  </p>
<p>Crews from the company were erecting the fifth floor of Chicago's new U.S. Postal Service Facility on November 3, 1993, when a portion of the building collapsed. Five other workers were injured.</p>
<p>The company was fined $147,000 in civil penalties in 1994 by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration for what the agency said was its &quot;deliberate disregard&quot; of safe engineering practices in the incident. The fine was dismissed on appeal, Lloyd said, and OSHA has appealed the dismissal.</p>
<p>In the indictment, the company was cited for not following rules that require structural supports be tightly secured with at least two bolts, or the equivalent. The company also allegedly violated regulations that require workers be trained to recognize and avoid unsafe conditions.</p>
