<p>Plains feedlot cattle markets Tuesday morning were stronger, with light sales at $67.00 per cwt, up $1.00 from a week ago, feedlot sources said.</p>
<p>About 500 head traded at $67.00 in Texas and western Oklahoma markets and about 600 sold in Kansas, they said.</p>
<p>However, the cattle were said to be of lesser quality than those that sold at $67.00 last week, sources said. Most feedlots were passing on further bids at the $67.00 level.</p>
<p>&quot;This has not opened the floodgates (on sales), because everybody wants $68.00,&quot; one Oklahoma cattleman said.  </p>
<p>The prospect of $68.00 cattle was growing closer as more feedlots pass packer bids at $67.00 amid talk that several packers were short on cattle inventories and need to buy cattle, sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;It looks like they're fixing to trade at $68.00, and once we get a few bids at that level, I think they (packers) will be buying cattle,&quot; a Kansas feedlot operator said.</p>
<p>There also was talk that at least one major packer had already paid $68.00 for about two thousand head in the Panhandle, but the sale was not reported yet, one market source said.</p>
