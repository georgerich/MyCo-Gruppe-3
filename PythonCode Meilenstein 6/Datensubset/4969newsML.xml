<title>UK: Oil prices dip, but Mexican storm stems the drift.</title>

<p>World oil prices continued to slide for the second day on Wednesday following the sharp gains posted over the past week.</p>
<p>But storm-related shutdowns of key oil export ports in Mexico kept a floor under prices, traders said.</p>
<p>October futures for world benchmark Brent Blend crude from the North Sea closed at $20.21 a barrel, 26 cents below Tuesday's close but five cents above Wednesday's low.</p>
<p>&quot;The market needs to come down from the lofty gains we saw earlier, but the Mexican storms drew in some buying,&quot; a London broker said.</p>
<p>Oil prices hit four-month highs in recent days as nervous buyers looked to top up low heating oil stocks ahead of the winter.</p>
<p>Tropical Storm Dolly forced Mexican state oil company Pemex to shut its three Gulf of Mexico oil ports on Wednesday. Mexico is a major supplier of oil to the United States and one of the world's largest oil producers.</p>
<p>But the shutdown was seen as precautionary and its bullish impact momentary, some traders said.</p>
<p>They said short-term supply-demand fundamentals led them to expect further price erosion.</p>
<p>Underlining the bearish undertone was news that some European refiners were slowing down production to combat weak profit margins.</p>
<p>Relatively high crude oil prices and low refined product prices have cut into refiner earnings in recent days, although there are signs of improvement.</p>
<p>Margins improved sharply on Tuesday after hitting 18-month lows on Friday but the recovery was not enough to stop some refineries in France, Italy, Sweden and Britain from cutting throughput.</p>
<p>When refiners cut runs, their appetite for crude oil falls as they use less of it to make refined products like gasoline and heating oil.</p>
