<headline>OPTIONS - PIBOR vols stay high after rate cuts.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-08-22</dateline>

<p>Implied volatility of PIBOR options on MATIF remained at high levels after interest rate cuts in Germany and France, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Most activity has been concentrated in the futures. There has been very little on the options -- the price is so wide that people don't know what it is worth,&quot; said Francois Magny, French desk trader at Nationsbank Europe.</p>
<p>&quot;People are concentrating on re-hedging their positions at the moment and once things have settled down I guess they'll look in the options.&quot;</p>
<p>The Bank of France reduced its intervention rate to 3.35 percent from 3.55 percent on Thursday after the Bundesbank cut its repo rate to 3.00 percent from 3.30 percent.</p>
<p>By 1410 GMT September PIBOR futures were trading 31 basis points higher on the day at 96.07.</p>
<p>Magny said movement in the smile on PIBOR options was one significant development after the interest rate cuts.</p>
<p>Smiles are volatility plays which take advantage of differences in implied vols and are so-called because the vol curve traces out a smile.</p>
<p>&quot;The smile is getting very acute. Puts are getting very well bid and the calls are getting much better offered,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said it was hard to predict how the market would change by the end of the day.</p>
<p>&quot;Most guys got caught short volatility. They got hurt on their move and they will be looking to buy back in the near future,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Players said options trading levels were low, making it difficult to establish the vol levels at which deals were going through.</p>
<p>Another trader at a French bank in Paris said implied volatility on September PIBOR options was at 42.0 percent and December at 32.0 percent -- both unchanged from Thursday closing levels.</p>
<p>&quot;Vol should go down in theory,&quot; he said. But he added that with the underlying market having gained so much so quickly, predicting future moves was tricky so vols continued to be well bid. &quot;It is not easy to sell volatility,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The trader said volatility levels would remain stable at present levels over the next 24 hours.</p>
<p>He said September vol figures meant nothing so close to contract expiry and December levels were more worth watching.</p>
<p>&quot;There will be transactions on longer maturities but everyone will look at this (December vols) to see what is happening.&quot;</p>
