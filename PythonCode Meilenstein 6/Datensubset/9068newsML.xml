<p>Ivory Coast's 1996/97 cocoa crop probably escaped damage from very heavy rains in early July but more sun was needed now to promote flowering and help ripen remaining mid-crop pods, buyers and crop analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Although it's been wetter than usual I don't see it as anything that will cause any real damage to the crop,&quot; one crop forecaster told Reuters.</p>
<p>Most early assessments of the coming 1996/97 (Oct-Sept) main crop predicted a smaller and later harvest than this year's one million-tonne October-April yield.</p>
<p>Current estimates are between 850,000 and 900,000 tonnes but traders are keenly awaiting updates that will factor-in the effects of very heavy July rainfall.</p>
<p>The crop forecaster said talk that the deluge had knocked large amounts of flowers from the trees was &quot;a bit far-fetched&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;If you look at the total rainfall in the period and the relatively high number of days they had rain, it doesn't look to me like it would knock flowers off the trees,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Up-country buyers said there may have been localised damage but they expected little impact overall.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think it will spoil the cocoa. It has rained and stopped, rained and stopped,&quot; said Ahmed Amer, a private buyer in the port of San Pedro.</p>
<p>Antoine Adou, an exporter's agent in the central town of Divo, said the July rains had flooded some farms and delayed flowering. But he said the weather had now improved in his area.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a bit of sun now so I think think flowering will improve and it could continue into November-December,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But conditions were still dull in the main growing areas further to the west, local weather officials told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;It has been raining a bit all over the west but it is lighter,&quot; one crop weather specialist said.</p>
<p>&quot;The soil is really a bit wet but that has not caused problems... Now they need a bit of sun to take the fruits to maturity in good condition,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Crop analysts said that although a prolonged cool and damp period would raise the risk of pods being attacked by blackpod fungus, it was generally less of a problem in Ivory Coast than in neighbouring Ghana.</p>
<p>&quot;If it's been wet in Ghana and we get heavier rain again in September there could be a significant blackpod problem there. It's never a big problem in Ivory,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>Up-country buyers said the rains had helped swell mid-crop pods and average bean counts were around 115 beans per 100 grammes against 130-140 at this time last year.</p>
<p>There had been a problem with high bean moisture levels in July but the situation had now improved, they added.</p>
<p>Almost all mid-crop beans were being delivered to local factories, they said, but they could not give a estimate of the weekly rate.</p>
<p>Trade sources tentatively put declared 1995/96 arrivals at 1.17-1.19 million tonnes to August 18 but they said reliable data were hard to get during the August holiday period.</p>
<p>One crop forecaster expected arrivals to pick up before the end of the season. &quot;There is a hell of a strong finish to the mid-crop,&quot; he said.</p>
