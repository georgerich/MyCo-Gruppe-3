<title>BOSNIA: Forgotten Bosnian prisoner on hunger strike.</title>
<headline>Forgotten Bosnian prisoner on hunger strike.</headline>

<p>A Bosnian soldier detained by Serbs for over two years has gone on hunger strike after the former warring parties showed no interest in including him in prisoner exchanges, the United Nations said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Zlatko Meimovic was captured by separatist Serb troops in February 1994 and was imprisoned in Pale before being shifted to the northeast Serb-controlled town of Bijeljina.</p>
<p>Under the Dayton peace treaty signed last December, Croat, Moslem and Serb factions were to release all prisoners of war earlier this year. Most were freed.</p>
<p>But Meimovic's case was complicated as he comes from an ethnically mixed family -- commonplace in Bosnia before nationalist war tore it apart.</p>
<p>&quot;The federal commission for prisoner exchanges didn't want to consider his case because his mother is a Croat, his father is a Moslem and his wife a Serb,&quot; Andrea Angeli, spokesman for U.N. police monitors in northeast Bosnia, told Reuters.</p>
<p>He said Meimovic had been on a hunger strike for the last 10 days to attract attention to his case and had sent letters to Serb authorities but had received no response so far.</p>
<p>The Serbs recently released four Bosnian army soldiers who had been arrested together with Meimovic, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;He is only drinking water. He has a cough and a fever and his general condition is quite weak.&quot;</p>
