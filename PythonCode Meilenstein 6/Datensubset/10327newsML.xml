<p>Chinese importers are expected to make incremental use of import quotas for 1.3 million tonnes of palm oil to avoid driving up the world price and pushing down the domestic price, Far East traders said on Friday.</p>
<p>China still has significant stocks of edible oil -- reported in official media to be 2.8 million tonnes by the end of October 1995 -- which could even keep China out of the palm oil market until early 1997, traders said.</p>
<p>A flurry in Malaysian palm oil futures prices on Friday, as speculators reacted to news the Chinese government had approved imports of 1.3 million tonnes of palm oil, was a knee-jerk reaction, trading sources around the region said.</p>
<p>&quot;This is just panic short-covering and speculative interest,&quot; a Singapore trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;People are just looking at the volume of 1.3 million tonnes, they are not looking at the market reality,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Import licences could be extended, said another trader, as those issued in 1995 had been for six months.</p>
<p>&quot;This is just the normal annual allocation,&quot; he said. &quot;Unless China buys a couple of hundred thousand tonnes a month, there is no justification for a market move, this is just on the news.</p>
<p>&quot;People have been talking about it for a month or more. There is no need (for China) to hurry,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Malaysian Primary Industries Minister Lim Keng Yaik said on Thursday China had approved imports of 1.3 million tonnes of palm oil between August 1996 and March 1997.</p>
<p>Malaysia would provide 80 percent of China's palm oil, Lim said, with the remainder coming from Indonesia.</p>
<p>At midday, the benchmark third position November crude palm oil futures contract was up 20 ringgit to 1,180 riggit (US$473.33) a tonne. Among refined products, November/December RBD palm olein was traded at $550 a tonne FOB Malaysia.</p>
<p>Traders said domestic Chinese palm oil prices were around 6,500 yuan ($783) a tonne.</p>
<p>Using the November/December bulk palm olein FOB Malaysia price as a benchmark, traders said importing did not make economical sense for China as costs, freight, insurance, and import and value-added taxes would push the price up to 7,552 yuan ($910) a tonne.</p>
<p>&quot;They are not likely to use the quotas straight away,&quot; another trader said.</p>
<p>Annual per capita consumption of edible oil in China is six kg (13.2 lb), compared with the average 16 kg (35.2 lb) in developed countries.</p>
<p>Traders said China had been importing about 100,000 tonnes a month of palm oil, mostly as bulk palm olein, up to June.</p>
<p>Palm olein is used by the food industry for manufacture of ice cream and cakes; palm oil is used for frying in the production of instant noodles.</p>
<p>Customs figures released this week show China's edible oil imports, including palm oil, in the first seven months of 1996 were 1.74 million tonnes, down 26.9 percent from the same period in 1995. July vegetable imports were nil, the figures show.</p>
<p>Palm oil imports for the first seven months of 1996 totalled 582,000 tonnes, trading sources said, down 40 percent on the same 1995 period.</p>
<p>Overbuying in 1995 was still hanging over the market, traders said. Some sources have predicted that current vegetable oil stocks could last until the end of 1996, and they point to soft domestic prices as proof.</p>
<p>Indeed, prices indicated in Shanghai on Wednesday showed vegetable oil prices falling to as low as 6,700 yuan ($807) a tonne, from 7,000 ($843) a tonne two weeks ago.</p>
<p>Soyoil fell to 7,200 a tonne, from around 7,500 two weeks ago, according to figures from the National Grains and Oils Information Centre.</p>
