<p>Dutch plastics and textiles processor Ten Cate NV said on Friday nearly all its operations had contributed to results, particularly those in plastics.</p>
<p>The company earlier reported first-half net profits jumped 60 percent to 17.5 million guilders from 11 million in the year-earlier period.</p>
<p>After adjustment for a four million guilder net extraordinary charge in 1995, net profit rose 17 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Operating profits were favourably influenced by the performance of almost all operating companies, particularly those in the plastics sector,&quot; Ten Cate said in a statement.</p>
<p>Restructuring programmes underway were delivering results, particularly at Ten Cate Protect and Plasticum, it said.</p>
<p>However, results at the Rubber Rollers group (Enbi Ten Cate) had lagged expectations due to a slowdown in market growth.</p>
<p>Raw materials prices and currency movements had lightly boosted net profits, the company added.</p>
<p>Recent unconsolidated acquisitions such as a 50 percent stake in Createc Rollers of France and Vencel Resil of the U.K. as well as Dutch specialist textiles firm Spinnerij Nijverdal would contribute to Ten Cate's full-year results, it said.</p>
