<p>The International Monetary Fund executive board on Wednesday released $330 million for Russia, saying the country's reform programme was now on target for July.</p>
<p>The funds, part of a $10.2 billion, three-year loan approved in February, had been delayed because of problems in the Russian government's efforts to collect taxes that raised questions about its overall economic reform programme.</p>
<p>&quot;Executive directors were satisfied that the Russian government and central bank met their July targets and are pursuing policies consistent with the attainment of macro-economic objectives of the programme,&quot; the IMF said.</p>
<p>The lending agency has been reviewing the programme on a month-by-month basis and dispensing additional funding as long as Russia met the targets of the programme. It said a further disbursement could become available next month if talks now being held in Moscow show adherence to the guidelines.</p>
<p>Russia ran into revenue problems this spring during the presidential election campaign when the government apparently slacked off on tax collection enforcement to win voter and corporate support.</p>
<p>In its statement, the IMF said it was pleased with steps taken to improve revenue collection, which caused the delay in the loan tranche. &quot;In particular, the board welcomed the steps taken to improve revenue performance, pending which there had been a hold up in disbursements under the IMF-supported programme,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Part of the IMF mission that had worked out details on the programme for July returned to Washington to report its findings, leading to the favourable decision by the executive board, while others had remained behind.</p>
<p>The current talks in Moscow cover the economic programme in its second quarter and for the fifth monthly review as IMF staff members pore over the country's books so that the loan agreement does not wander off course.</p>
<p>The lending agency has already provided $1.32 billion and the additional $330 million that it just approved will find its way into Russian coffers on Monday, the IMF said.</p>
