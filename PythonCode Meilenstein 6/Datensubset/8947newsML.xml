<p>Robusta coffee futures reversed direction in Thursday's afternoon session as a strong arabicas market prompted arbitrage buying interest from fund players in the London market, traders said.</p>
<p>Earlier, selling from origins such as Indonesia knocked robusta prices lower but then buying emerged to take advantage of the higher values in New York, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;Since we broke $1,689 on November, which was the high from last week, we've seen a little bit more fund buying,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>&quot;Most of the buying up to now was trade buying in London and selling New York against it,&quot; he said, adding that there were origin scale-up sellers in both markets.</p>
<p>At the close the benchmark November contract stood up $16 at $1,695, after briefly piercing resistance at $1,700 with its intraday high of $1,705.</p>
<p>All other traded positions ended firmer and overall volume totalled 4,407 lots.</p>
<p>Concerns about a scarcity of available coffee for September in New York -- despite a sharp fall in the contract's open interest -- has kept the arabicas market heated recently with attention centred on the Sept/Dec spread.</p>
