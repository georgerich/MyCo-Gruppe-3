<headline>CSCE coffee ends higher, spot supply woes persist.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-08-21</dateline>

<p>Commission house and fund buying lifted CSCE coffee futures higher Wednesday, fueled by concerns about a scarcity of available coffee for delivery against the September contract, traders said.</p>
<p>With spot September's first notice day on Thursday, traders noted that September open interest was still relatively high at 3,356 lots as of August 20, compared with the low level of certified stocks.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a typical tight stock situation,&quot; said Smith Barney analyst Walter Spilka.</p>
<p>He said a decline in U.S. certified coffee stocks this week underscored the shortage of nearby supplies. Exchange inventories dropped 6,259 60-kg bags in the week ended August 16, to 34,516 bags, their lowest levels in 10 years.</p>
<p>The CSCE also reported 19,000 bags of coffee pending certification, but while traders and analysts said the pending coffee would help ease supply woes, not all the coffee was expected to meet Exchange approval.</p>
<p>Spot September settled up 2.55 cents a lb, at 125.05. Most-active December closed 1.95 cents higher at 117.00 cents, after reaching a peak of 118.40. Dealers noted origin selling near the highs trimmed gains.  </p>
<p>Dealers said the switches were heavily traded, with the closely watched September/December switch widening to 8.05 cents on Wednesday, compared to 7.45 cents at Tuesday's close.</p>
<p>On the charts, traders said the December contract would face stiff resistance at 120.00, while support was seen at 115.00.</p>
<p>Volume was heavy, at an estimated 12,238 lots.</p>
