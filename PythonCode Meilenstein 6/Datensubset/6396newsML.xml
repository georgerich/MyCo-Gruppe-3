<p>Dwindling supplies of old crop corn, reports of aflatoxin in the Texas crop and jitters about possible harvest delays in the U.S. South as Tropical Storm Dolly threatens the U.S. Gulf Coast, boosted nearby September corn to a higher close, traders said.</p>
<p>September also found support from a rebound in some interior cash corn basis markets and there was active bull spreading of September/December in late dealings, they said.</p>
<p>Other months were lower on Midwest weather that has shifted to a more conducive pattern for crop production.</p>
<p>&quot;People are concerned with the moisture in the South. There's good commercial buying and it's going to get more and more squirrely as the trade realizes how tight supplies are,&quot; said Steve Bruce of E.D. and F. Man International.</p>
<p>Participants of a crop tour sponsored by Professional Farmers of America overnight heard from Indiana state officials who confirmed the state's crop was well behind average maturity dates. Also the tour group said corn yield potential appeared below the level seen by the tour last year.</p>
<p>Corn closed four cents per bushel higher to two lower, with September up four at $3.66-1/4 a bushel.</p>
<p>Corn futures volume was estimated at 45,000, up from 38,392 Tuesday.</p>
<p>In the corn options pit, The Chicago Corp sold 400 March $3.30 puts at 13-1/2, Continental Grain bought 200 September $3.60 Puts at 1-5/8 and bought 250 December $3.20 calls at 28-3/4 cents, traders said.</p>
<p>Corn options volume was estimated at 17,000, up from 16,112 Tuesday.</p>
