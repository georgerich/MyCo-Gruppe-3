<p>Argentina's YPF SA said Friday it had reached a preliminary agreement with Petroecuador which &quot;unblocks the existing situation&quot; over the operations of its Maxus  subsidiary in Ecuador.</p>
<p>YPF said in a statement: &quot;Today a preliminary agreement was reached between Petroecuador and the contractors of Block 16 -- situated in Ecuador's Amazon region -- of which YPF-Maxus is the majority partner and operator.</p>
<p>&quot;This accord unblocks the existing situation and puts into action a negotiation mechanism with the object of changing the present services contract into a joint-venture contract.&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;The contractors and Petroecuador commit themselves to agree the terms and conditions of the new accord in a maximum of 30 days,&quot; YPF said.</p>
<p>Ecuador's government announced late Tuesday that it was banning Maxus from continuing its operations in Ecuador until it reaches a joint-venture deal to share production with state-owned Petroecuador.</p>
<p>YPF added that it expressed to Ecuador's Mines and Energy Minister Alfredo Adum &quot;its will to negotiate and the desire that the best solutions benefitting all interested parties be achieved without confrontation.&quot;  </p>
<p>YPF, which has bought the Dallas-based Maxus, Wednesday said its subsidiary's facilities in Ecuador were producing normally despite the Ecuadoran decision.</p>
<p>Ecuador's government said that it was revising all oil contracts with foreign companies.</p>
<p>Late Thursday Petroecuador announced it had reached a preliminary deal with Maxus, but a Maxus spokesman in Dallas said talk of a solution to the problem was &quot;premature&quot;.</p>
