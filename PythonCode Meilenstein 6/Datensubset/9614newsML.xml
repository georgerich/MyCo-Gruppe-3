<p>MGE spring wheat futures ended higher on short covering tied to a rally in CBOT beans and corn, traders said.</p>
<p>MGE spring wheat had been lower at the midsession, pressured by a lack of export news. But rumors of Japanese or Chinese buying helped spark a surge in CBOT soymeal and soybeans. Support also came from bullish reports emerging from an annual corn and soybean crop tour.</p>
<p>&quot;When beans and corn started to take off, people in here had no choice but to cover the shorts they had assumed at the open,&quot; a MGE floor source said.</p>
<p>Traders said Wilson Trading sold two million Sept and one million Dec bushels. Benson Quinn also sold two million Dec, which traders said was done on the intermarket spread with KCBT wheat. CIS bought one million Dec, traders said.</p>
<p>MGE spring wheat closed 1/2 to 3-3/4 cents per bushel higher, with Sept up two cents at $4.63-1/2. Dec gained 1-1/4 cents to close at $4.58-1/2.</p>
