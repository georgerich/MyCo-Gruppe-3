<p>PALMOIL FUTURES - Prices surged on news China has approved imports of 1.3 million tonnes of palm oil. Afternoon values further boosted by talk India's STC is seeking to buy up to 250,000 tonnes palm oil for Sep/Oct shipment. Immediate upside seen capped at 1,200.</p>
<p>PALMOIL PHYSICALS - Also firmed on increased buying in afternoon. Trades confined to crude palm oil and palm olein.  </p>
<p>Traders said purchases from China would further boost Malaysian exports which have been expected to remain healthy in the next few months.</p>
<p>Afternoon prices were further boosted by talk that India's State Trading Corporation (STC) was in the market for up to 250,000 tonnes of palm oil for September/October shipment. This was denied by an STC official in Singapore.</p>
<p>Traders said the STC was unlikely to be buying such a huge quantity as its purchases have been in lots of 6,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>&quot;It was not shown in its purchases so far if it's going to buy such a huge amount,&quot; a dealer said.  </p>
<p>The STC last bought 6,000 tonnes of palm olein on Wednesday for last half September shipment.</p>
<p>Traders also doubted whether China's approval of the import quota would translate into real deals.</p>
<p>They said high palm oil prices would deter Chinese importers, who have been buying cheaper soybean oil and had no immediate need to switch to palm oil.</p>
<p>&quot;Just because they have been allowed to import palm oil does not mean they have to buy,&quot; said a trader who has done deals with China. &quot;China will not pay at these prices.&quot;  </p>
<p>Benchmark third position Nov crude palm oil futures closed up 36 ringgit at 1,196 ringgit ($479.74) a tonne. Traders said immediate upside for the contract could be capped at 1,200.</p>
