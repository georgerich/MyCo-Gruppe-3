<title>SOUTH AFRICA: Gold Fields battling violent union action.</title>
<headline>Gold Fields battling violent union action.</headline>

<p>Gold Fields of South Africa Ltd has been hit by violent trade union action at three of its mines which has claimed the lives of at least 17 miners in the past two weeks.</p>
<p>Production at the Leeudoorn division of Kloof Gold Mining Company Ltd was at a standstill after the killing of four miners in clashes between supporters of rival unions on Monday, Gold Fields spokeswoman Marian Brower said.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Gold Fields executive director Alan Munro and the president of the powerful National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), James Motlatsi met in a bid to defuse the situation which has cost millions of rand in lost production.</p>
<p>&quot;They wholeheartedly expressed their respective commitment to preventing any further violence and restoring a climate of peaceful co-existence of all employees,&quot; they said in a joint statement after the talks.</p>
<p>Brower said the conflict at Leeudoorn and violence at Driefontein Consolidated Mines Ltd's east mine in which seven miners were killed last week, was costing millions of rand in lost production.</p>
<p>&quot;It will probably run into millions by now,&quot; she said, adding that no production had been taking place at Leeudoorn for the past three days.</p>
<p>She said production at Leeudoorn, which produced 1,544 kg of gold in the quarter to end June, could be delayed further.</p>
<p>&quot;We are probably not going to start production until we have solved the problems on surface,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>In other violence at a Gold Fields-managed mine, six more miners were killed in fighting at Northam Platinum Ltd on August 11.</p>
<p>Brower said it was possible that the conflict at the three mines -- pitting NUM supporters against miners loyal to the United Workers Union of South Africa (Uwusa) -- could be linked.</p>
<p>&quot;It is the same thing, it is exactly the same thing at all three operations. It is beginning to look like more than coincidence,&quot; Brower said.</p>
<p>NUM said it condemned the latest violence at Leeudoorn and warned that any union members found to be behind the conflict would be regarded as having dismissed themselves from the union.</p>
<p>&quot;We will not tolerate violence from our members towards other workers,&quot; Motlatsi said in a statement on Tuesday.</p>
<p>NUM is aligned to President Nelson Mandela's ruling African National Congress (ANC) while the much smaller Uwusa has strong links to the rival Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party. --Marius Bosch, Johannesburg newsroom, +27-11 482 1003</p>
