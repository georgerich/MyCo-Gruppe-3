<p>Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan on Wednesday defended a $23-billion natural gas deal with Iran that has hindered U.S. attempts to isolate Tehran through sanctions.</p>
<p>&quot;What could be more natural than us getting such cheap, abundant natural gas from right next door?&quot; Erbakan, an Islamist who heads a coalition with a conservative party, told a news conference on return from a 10-day official trip abroad.</p>
<p>&quot;The American administration has shown understanding but certain circles in America are assessing (the deal) negatively,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Washington said earlier this month it would slap sanctions on companies investing more than $40 million in energy projects in Iran and Libya, calling them &quot;two supporters of terrorism.&quot;</p>
<p>Already, the the United States has condemned the Turkey-Iran deal but said last week it was too early to decide whether to punish NATO ally Turkey.</p>
<p>Erbakan, the first Islamic leader in Turkey, a secular state with an overwhelmingly Moslem population, was in Iran at the start of his trip when the two countries signed the deal.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to improve all kinds of relations with both the East and the West,&quot; he said. &quot;This sincere desire was openly expressed on our visit.&quot; He also visited Pakistan, Singapore and Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>Under the gas deal, a pipeline is to be built from the Iranian city of Tabriz to Ankara beginning in 1999.</p>
<p>Turkey, facing an energy shortage, will buy a total of 190 billion cubic metres by the year 2022.</p>
<p>Erbakan's visit to predominantly Moslem countries fulfilled a pledge after coming to power late in June to strengthen ties with Turkey's Moslem neighbours, who he said have been neglected in the past at the expense of relations with the West.</p>
<p>Trade agreements signed during the tour, many of them linked to defence projects, will be worth a potential $9 billion and will contribute towards correcting the country's sizeable trade deficit, he said.</p>
<p>Since coming to power, Erbakan has sought to maintain good relations with Turkey's NATO and European allies, easing earlier radical Islamist statements.</p>
<p>The West also persuaded him to give his backing to the extension of a U.S.-led air force operation based in southern Turkey protecting Kurds in northern Iraq from attack by Baghdad.</p>
<p>A fresh challenge to Turkey's northern Iraq policy confronted Erbakan on his return after reports of contacts between an Iraqi Kurdish group and the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). Turkish officials say PKK rebels use northern Iraq as a base to launch attacks on southern Turkey.</p>
<p>Erbakan said Turkey was ready to work with all its neighbours to eradicate rebel activities. He said agreement had been reached with Tehran during his visit to prevent PKK border incursions from Iran.</p>
