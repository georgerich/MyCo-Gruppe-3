<p>Boris Yeltsin's new security chief cast doubts on the authenticity of presidential orders on the Chechen crisis on Tuesday, fuelling speculation on who was running Russia as the Kremlin denied the president was sick.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, 65, has not been seen in public since he put in a somewhat wooden appearance during his inauguration for his second term on August 9. His absence has led to media reports in Russia and in the West that he had been taken seriously ill.</p>
<p>His spokesman on Tuesday denied a new report he was being treated for a serious heart condition and said he had left for a short holiday in the Valdai lakeland northwest of Moscow.</p>
<p>&quot;Boris Nikolayevich has gone to Valdai for two days,&quot; spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky told NTV commercial television.</p>
<p>&quot;It takes two hours and 20 minutes by helicopter and the very fact that the president has spent that much time in a helicopter is the best evidence to rebut rumours that have been circulating about his health recently.&quot;</p>
<p>But the Security Council, whose tough-talking secretary Alexander Lebed was appointed by Yeltsin two months ago, issued a statement saying his latest order on Chechnya bore a facsimile signature and seemed to have been prepared without him.</p>
<p>&quot;The contents of the documents give solid grounds to doubt that the president of Russia took a direct part in finalising the text of the order,&quot; the Security Council statement said.</p>
<p>It said an order instructing Lebed to restore Russian control of Grozny was the cue for the army to threaten a massive bombardment of the Chechen capital from Thursday morning and would wreck Lebed's peacemaking efforts.</p>
<p>Yeltsin's press office was later quoted by Itar-Tass news agency as insisting the order was fully in line with Yeltsin's wishes and saying he wanted the council to drop the matter.</p>
<p>Russian political analysts played down the bickering in the Kremlin, however, saying Yeltsin still appeared to be in overall command and simply to be letting his subordinates find the best way to limit the political damage from the Chechen debacle.</p>
<p>Yeltsin has admitted that sending troops to Chechnya to crush its independence bid was &quot;maybe one of our mistakes&quot;.</p>
<p>Hopes of peace rose when Yeltsin named Lebed his representative in the region last week. Lebed has visited the region twice and helped broker a shaky truce. Tass said he would go there again on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Russian commander General Konstantin Pulikovsky, who had signed a ceasefire order on Saturday, accused the guerrillas of using the truce to dig in. &quot;I see force as the only way out of the situation in Grozny,&quot; he told Interfax news agency.</p>
<p>Hundreds of people have been killed in Chechnya in the last two weeks, since rebel fighters swept into the capital Grozny, capturing key buildings and surrounding Russian soldiers at their checkpoints and in the central government compound.</p>
<p>Terrified civilians flooded out of Grozny on Tuesday, many of them with little more than the clothes they wore. Pulikovsky gave them 48 hours until Thursday to get out, although finding a way through ruins and sporadic fighting was not easy.</p>
<p>Refugees said Russian planes had started bombing the town, much of it already in ruins after attacks at the start of Russia's campaign to crush Chechnya's independence bid.</p>
<p>&quot;The whole city is on its way out,&quot; said Nina Madayeva, who said 12 planes had bombed Grozny's southwestern Chernorechye district overnight. &quot;We've been in a basement for 14 or 15 days and couldn't stand it any more.&quot;</p>
<p>Kremlin spokesman Yastrzhembsky said Yeltsin would consider a longer holiday in Valdai but dismissed as &quot;complete rubbish&quot; a report by Ekho Moskvy radio that the president had been in a specialist cardiological centre since August 15.</p>
<p>Journalists at Ekho Moskvy told Reuters they stuck by their story, which said Yeltsin, who suffered two heart attacks last year, had been diagnosed with moderately serious heart trouble.</p>
<p>He said on Tuesday that the president and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, who would deputise for Yeltsin if he were incapable of working, were continuing to work on formation of the new government, most of which was announced last week.</p>
<p>Rebel chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov appealed to Lebed to rein in the army. He should &quot;use all of his influence to stop the approaching madness&quot;, Interfax quoted Maskhadov as saying.</p>
