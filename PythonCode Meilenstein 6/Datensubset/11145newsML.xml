<p>Hurricane Dolly crashed into Mexico's Veracruz state on Friday, killing at least two people and leaving a trail of destruction before being downgraded to a tropical storm, authorities and news reports said.</p>
<p>Dolly, the fourth big weather system of the Atlantic season, ploughed into the northern tip of the largely agricultural Veracruz, ripping down telephone wires and electric poles, smashing windows and uprooting trees.</p>
<p>One woman died when she was hit by a high tension cable that crashed to the ground as Dolly came ashore around 11 a.m. EDT (1500 GMT), close to the port of Tampico in the Gulf of Mexico, media reports said.</p>
<p>The National television network Televisa said heavy rains brought on by Dolly in the northern state of Nuevo Leon, killed a man when he was swept away by strong currents in the Topo Chico River in the industrial city of Monterrey.</p>
<p>Later on Friday, Dolly was downgraded to a tropical depression as it moved over Mexico while Tropical Storm Edouard, still hundreds of miles from land, gained hurricane strength, the National Hurricane Center said.</p>
<p>At 5 p.m. EDT (2100 GMT), the center of former hurricane Dolly was located at latitude 21.8 north, longitude 99.7 west, about 90 miles (145 km) east-southeast of San Luis Potosi, Mexico, and was moving west at 16 mph (26 kph).</p>
<p>Maximum sustained winds dropped to 35 mph (56 kph).</p>
<p>Forecasters said they expected Dolly to break up in the mountains but warned residents to be alert for torrential rains and life-threatening flash floods. The storm could dump six to 12 inches (15-30 cm) of rain on parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>Hurricane Edouard strengthened as it moved through the Atlantic Ocean but was far from land and a threat only to shipping.</p>
<p>At 5 p.m. EDT (2100 GMT), the center of Edouard was located at latitude 13.9 north, longitude 40.7 west, about 1,385 miles (2,200 km) east of the Lesser Antilles and moving west at 15 mph (24 kph).</p>
<p>Maximum sustained winds had climbed to 75 mph (120 kph), making it a Category one hurricane, and further strengthening was expected, forecasters said.</p>
<p>Hurricane-force winds extended 35 miles (56 km) from the center and tropical storm-force winds extended 175 miles (280 km) from the center.</p>
<p>Radio network Radio Red reported 2,300 people were evacuated from the low lying regions around Tampico because of Hurricane Dolly and rivers were rapidly rising in the region from the torrential rains dumped over a wide area of southern and eastern Mexico.</p>
<p>Ruben Diaz Garza, director of the local newspaper El Sol de Tampico, told Reuters Dolly had made around 1,500 people homeless and that the entire port of some 500,000 was without electricity and drinking water.</p>
<p>Dolly raced across the Caribbean this week to slam into Mexico's Quintana Roo state on Tuesday. It burst into the Gulf of Mexico on Wednesday after crossing the Yucatan Peninsula on Wednesday, home to hundreds of Maya ruins.</p>
