<p>Commonwealth ministers concerned about human rights in Nigeria may cancel a planned trip there because of government restrictions on their mission, Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;The reaction of the regime there is such that many of us feel that the mission under the present circumstances shouldn't go ahead,&quot; Axworthy said.</p>
<p>Foreign ministers of the British Commonwealth, which suspended Nigeria because of concerns about democracy and alleged human rights abuses, will meet in London on Wednesday to discuss what to do, he told a news conference.</p>
<p>Members of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group had planned to visit the Nigerian capital Abuja on August 29-30.</p>
<p>Canada has pressed for stronger action against Nigeria rather than relying mainly on fact-finding missions and dialogue, and appeared ready to press the case in the London meeting.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of members were counting on this (mission) being a great breakthrough. It doesn't look like it's going to be that way. So it may be that we'll have to now consider collective action,&quot; he said, noting the impact from action taken by African states against Burundi.</p>
<p>He said the intention had been for the members of the team not just to meet with Nigerian government officials but to do fact-finding on their own, discussing human rights and democracy with private groups.</p>
<p>But the Nigerian foreign ministry issued a statement on Thursday saying the visit should not be construed as a fact-finding mission.</p>
<p>One of the triggers to the international outcry against Nigeria was the execution last November of author Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other minority rights activists on charges of murder.</p>
<p>His brother called on Canada in an Ottawa news conference on Thursday to urge fellow Commonwealth nations to impose an oil embargo on the country, Africa's most populous nation.</p>
<p>Axworthy said that in any case Canada was moving ahead with its own measures.</p>
<p>He said, for example, that Christine Stewart, the junior minister who was to have gone to Nigeria, has been working with Canadian oil companies on a voluntary code of conduct regarding Nigeria.</p>
