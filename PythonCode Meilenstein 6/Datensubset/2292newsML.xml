<title>USA: Blue chips end up as Fed keeps interest rates steady.</title>
<headline>Blue chips end up as Fed keeps interest rates steady.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK</dateline>
<text>
<p>Blue-chip stocks rallied Tuesday after the Federal Reserve held interest rates steady, the dollar rose after a drop in the June trade deficit, and bonds ended little changed.</p>
<p>Crude oil fell after rising on Monday. Gold edged higher.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 21.82 points at 5,721.26, putting the blue-chip index within a stone's throw of its record closing high of 5,778.00 set on May 22.</p>
<p>In the broader market, advancing issues led declines 1,230 to 1,068 on moderate volume of 334 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>The central bank's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee ended its meeting in early afternoon and kept interest rates unchanged, allowing Wall Street to hurdle any lingering fears of a surprise increase.</p>
<p>&quot;It was as expected. If we can neutralise the interest rate factor here, prices can go higher,&quot; said Richard Cripps, chief market strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker.</p>
<p>The Fed had been expected to hold interest rates steady amid signs the economy was slowing after strong second quarter growth without inflation heating up.</p>
<p>But investors still preferred to hold back until the policy-makers announced that they were keeping short term rates unchanged.</p>
<p>The independent Fed also sought to stay out of the line of political fire in the approach to the Nov. 5 presidential and congressional elections.</p>
<p>After growing at its fastest pace in two years in the second quarter, the economy looks to have slowed recently as the housing market has weakened and retail sales have stalled.</p>
<p>Blue-chips actually pared their gains shortly after the Fed news.</p>
<p>&quot;For a few seconds it looked like the buy the rumour, sell the fact. But then the Dow came back up and it's hard to find any indices doing anything spectacular,&quot; said Joseph Barthel, chief investment strategist at Fahnestock &amp; Co.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a Dow-inspired rally and in some ways because of the liquidity factor, visibility and safety,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, weakness in high-technology stocks pressured the technology-studded Nasdaq composite index, which closed down 6.24 points at 1,124.67.</p>
<p>In currency markets, the dollar climbed above 108 yen after the Commerce Department reported the United States trade gap shrank 23 percent in June as imports of merchandise and petroleum fell sharply.</p>
<p>While the trade shortfall with Japan rose 3.6 percent in June, the second-quarter deficit of $10.5 billion with Japan was the smallest quarterly deficit in five years.</p>
<p>The trend boosted the dollar since it decreased the amount of dollars foreign exporters will need to sell for their local currencies.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a good trade number,&quot; said Greg Pearman, chief foreign exchange dealer at Credit Commerciale de France in New York. &quot;There was definitely one huge buyer today who right after the (trade) number bought a lot of dollars for yen.&quot;</p>
<p>Late in New York, the dollar settled at 108.35 yen, up from 107.80 yen late on Monday. The dollar rose slightly to 1.4883 German marks from 1.4880 marks.</p>
<p>In the bond market, the yield on the 30-year Treasury ended unchanged at 6.80 percent.</p>
<p>Crude oil for September delivery lost 40 cents to $22.86 a barrel at the New York Mercantile Exchange. September gold added 50 cents to close at $388.60 an ounce at New York's Commodity Exchange.</p>
<p>Overseas, Britain's FTSE 100 climbed 19.5 points to a record 3,883.2, surpassing the old mark of 3,872.9 set just last week. Japan's 225-share Nikkei average rose 20.60 points to 21,127.01.</p>
