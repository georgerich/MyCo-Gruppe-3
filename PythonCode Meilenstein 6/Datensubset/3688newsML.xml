<title>USA: CBOT corn closes lower on warm weather talk.</title>
<headline>CBOT corn closes lower on warm weather talk.</headline>

<p>Talk about potential warmer weather next week in the U.S. Midwest rather than colder, pressured CBOT corn futures to a lower close, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Warmer temperatures are coming, supposedly,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>Meteorologists early Tuesday said weather maps now indicate warm weather will remain in the U.S. Midwest through next week. That scenario is in contrast to Monday's forecasts for a potential cool down in key U.S. corn growing states.</p>
<p>Corn futures trading was unsettled amid the uncertainty about weather outlooks.</p>
<p>The U.S. corn crop needs warm weather to boost the maturity pace which is lagging the year-ago and average rate.</p>
<p>USDA Monday said the U.S. crop as of Sunday was in the dough stage of development on 37 percent of the acreage, behind the 43 percent pace a year ago and behind the 55 percent pace of a year ago.</p>
<p>The government also cited a decline in condition ratings for the crop with 62 percent of the crop good to excellent as of Sunday down from 64 percent in that category a week ago.</p>
<p>Corn closed 3-1/2 cents per bushel lower to one cent higher, with September down 1-3/4 at $3.62-1/4.</p>
<p>Traders said corn may have been underpinned by a rally in soybeans plus indications of possible low corn yields in parts of Indiana relayed by participants of this week's Professional Farmers of America crop tour.</p>
<p>But traders said the tour Tuesday was in the eastern growing region of the U.S. where it has been expected that corn yields would not come up to average levels.</p>
<p>Corn futures volume was estimated at 47,000, down from 59,214 Monday.</p>
<p>Corn options trading again was quiet with volume estimated at 11,000, down from 15,536 Monday.</p>
