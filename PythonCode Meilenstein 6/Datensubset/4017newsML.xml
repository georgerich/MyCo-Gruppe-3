<p>An Israeli soldier was killed and another seriously wounded on Tuesday inside Israel's south Lebanon occupation zone when a group of Israeli soldiers fired on another group by mistake, security sources said.</p>
<p>They said a group of soldiers mistook another group for Moslem guerrillas in Wadi Zibqeen, on the edge of the western sector of the buffer zone and opened fire at five a.m. (0200 GMT).</p>
<p>One soldier was killed and another was wounded. The body and the wounded soldier were immediately flown to Israel by helicopter. The sources did not give further details.</p>
<p>In a statement issued in Jerusalem the Israeli army identified the dead man as Staff Sergeant Valery Ganzman, 22, and confirmed that another soldier was severely wounded.</p>
<p>It said they were hit &quot;by misdirected fire during operations in the western sector of the security zone&quot; but gave no further details.</p>
<p>Later, Israeli gunmen and their local militia allies shelled the village of Zibqeen outside the zone heavily damaging three houses. No casualties were reported in the bombardment, Lebanese security sources said.</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had visited the zone on Monday and warned the pro-Iranian Hizbollah that its raids on Israeli forces would only worsen the conflict.</p>
<p>Hours after he spoke a militiaman of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army (SLA) was killed by a guerrilla bomb while on patrol, SLA sources said.</p>
<p>Israeli troops, assisted by 3,000 SLA militiamen, hold a 15-km (nine-mile) wide zone in south Lebanon since 1985. Hizbollah (Party of God) guerrillas often attack the occupation troops in a bid to oust them from Lebanon.</p>
