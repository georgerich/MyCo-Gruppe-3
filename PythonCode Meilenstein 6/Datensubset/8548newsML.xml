<p>Kenny Dalglish spoke on Thursday of his sadness at leaving Blackburn, the club he led to the English premier league title in 1994-95.</p>
<p>Blackburn announced on Wednesday they and Dalglish had parted by mutual consent.</p>
<p>But the ex-manager confessed on Thursday to being &quot;sad&quot; at leaving after taking Blackburn from the second division to the premier league title inside three and a half years.</p>
<p>In a telephone call to a local newspaper from his holiday home in Spain, Dalglish said: &quot;We came to the same opinion, albeit the club came to it a little bit earlier than me.&quot;</p>
<p>He added: &quot;If no one asked, I never opened my mouth. I have stayed out of the way and let them get on with the job. The club thought it (the job) had run its course and I came to the same conclusion.&quot;</p>
<p>Dalglish had been with Blackburn for nearly five years, first as manager and then, for the past 15 months, as director of football.</p>
