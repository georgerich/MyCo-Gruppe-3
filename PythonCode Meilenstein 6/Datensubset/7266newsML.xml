<p>---------------------- Aug 21 -------------------------</p>
<p>	     * Central Bank cuts overnight rates</p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>The Philippine call loan rate rose for the third straight session on Wednesday to 11.96875 percent from 11.84375 as liquidity tightened, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Rates in the interbank market continued to rise despite the cut in Central Bank overnight rates as most funds of major banks were invested in fixed-income securities,&quot; one trader said.  </p>
<p>Early on Wednesday, the Central Bank cut its overnight borrowing rate to 10.5 percent from 10.75 while its lending rate dropped to 13 percent from 13.25.</p>
<p>Done rates ranged from 12.03125 percent to 11.0. Volume increased to 28.215 billion pesos from 22.244 billion.</p>
<p>There were 29 borrowers, including major banks, and 36 lenders.  </p>
<p>Trading in government securities was dull, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;There were a lot of sellers but there were no takers,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>Three-month bills were quoted at 12 percent, six-month bills at 12.4 percent, and one-year bills at 13 percent.</p>
