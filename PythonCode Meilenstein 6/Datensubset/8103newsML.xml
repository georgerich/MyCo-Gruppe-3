<headline>Iraqi Kurd group denies military aid from Iran.</headline>

<p>An Iraqi Kurdish guerrilla group denied on Thursday accusations by a rival militia that Iran was lending it military support in fighting between northern Iraq's Kurds.</p>
<p>&quot;(The allegations) are absolutely unfounded and false. This is a desperate attempt to confuse the facts of the situation,&quot; the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) said in a statement.</p>
<p>The rival Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) said on Wednesday that Iranian artillery had killed or wounded about 100 people in daily bombardments of Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq this week in support of the PUK.</p>
<p>Fresh fighting between the Kurdish groups broke out at the weekend, shattering a ceasefire brokered by the United States early last year.</p>
<p>The PUK, led by Jalal Talabani, repeated a charge that the Iraqi government was aiding the KDP in the fighting.</p>
<p>&quot;The KDP's latest escalation of the conflict was achieved with weaponry and military assistance it has received from Saddam Hussein's regime,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>The clashes are taking place in a Kurdish enclave protected from Baghdad by a U.S.-led air force based in southern Turkey since shortly after the 1991 Gulf War.</p>
<p>Washington on Wednesday urged the rival Kurdish parties to stop fighting and accept a U.S. invitation to peace talks in London.</p>
<p>Northern Iraq has been split into rival Kurdish zones since fighting broke out between the two groups in 1994. Around 3,000 people died until the ceasefire last March.</p>
