<p>Reigning Miss Universe, Venezuela's Alicia Machado, will keep the title even if she remains a few pounds overweight, Venezuelan beauty pageant officials said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;She obviously has a weight problem which affects her swimsuit contracts but this does not mean she will be stripped of her crown,&quot; a top Miss Venezuela Organisation official told Reuters.</p>
<p>Machado was in the resort town of Las Cruces, New Mexico, on Tuesday to attend the 1996 Miss Teen USA Pageant in her official capacity as Miss Universe, teen pageant officials said. They said the 19-year-old Machado was there as the pageant's guest of honour, not to shed pounds.</p>
<p>Officials of the Los Angeles-based Miss Universe organisation declined comment on Machado's weight problem.</p>
<p>Machado was scheduled to make a public appearance during the teen pageant, which was to be held on Wednesday night at New Mexico State University and broadcast nationwide by CBS television, pageant officials said.</p>
<p>Miss Teen USA officials said Machado would not talk to reporters before the pageant and it was unclear if she would have anything to say publicly when the event was over.</p>
<p>Miss Venezuela officials had said on Monday that Machado had been given an ultimatum by Miss Universe organisers to lose 27 pounds (12 kg) in two weeks or risk losing the title. She was 5 feet 7 inches (1.73 meters) tall and weighed 112 pounds (51 kilos) when she became the fourth Venezuelan to win the crown in Las Vegas in May.</p>
<p>While the Miss Universe title &quot;does not include any weight clauses,&quot; Machado should learn to control her appetite for the sake of her image, the pageant official said.</p>
<p>After she was awarded the title, Machado told reporters in Las Vegas she planned to do &quot;something I haven't been able to do in three weeks: eat, eat, eat and sleep.&quot;</p>
<p>Those close to the beauty queen said she has difficulty sticking to diets and a weakness for pastas and cakes.</p>
