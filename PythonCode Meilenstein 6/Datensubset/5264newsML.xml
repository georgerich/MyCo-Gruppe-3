<title>SWEDEN: Volvo profits rise more than expected.</title>
<headline>Volvo profits rise more than expected.</headline>
<dateline>STOCKHOLM, Sweden</dateline>

<p>Swedish automaker AB Volvo Wednesday reported a slightly higher than expected first half pre-tax profit of 3.86 billion crowns ($585.3 million) and said its restructuring was continuing.</p>
<p>Volvo said positive net interest income and share sales improved profit in the first six months of 1996 by 453 million crowns ($68.7 million).</p>
<p>&quot;Net interest income of 633 million crowns ($96.0 million) and gains of 453 million crowns ($68.7 million) on the sale of shares contributed to net earnings on a level with first half 1995 results,&quot; the company said in a statement.</p>
<p>Volvo said its drive to concentrate on its automotive operations, which began in 1994, had been virtually completed.</p>
<p>But it said income for vehicle operations was substantially lower than in the first half of 1995 due to product and market development costs, the introduction of new products and declining markets and profitability for Volvo Trucks in North and South America.</p>
<p>Volvo reported sales of 78.06 billion crowns ($1.2 billion) for the first half compared with 85.13 billion ($1.3 billion) a year earlier.</p>
<p>It said Volvo Car returned to the black in the second quarter of 1996, aided by cost-cutting, after losses in the two previous quarters even though sales were 7 percent lower than a year ago.</p>
<p>The car unit reported an operating profit of 187 million crowns ($28.4 million), against 1.58 million ($239,600) a year ago on sales of 39.83 billion crowns ($6.0 billion).</p>
