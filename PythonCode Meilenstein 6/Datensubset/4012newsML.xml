<title>TURKEY: Ten reported dead in Iraqi Kurd clashes.</title>
<headline>Ten reported dead in Iraqi Kurd clashes.</headline>

<p>At least 10 people have died in several days of fighting between rival Kurdish groups in northern Iraq, Iraqi Kurds said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>A Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) spokesman in Ankara told Reuters the group's forces killed eight fighters of the rival Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) on Sunday night near the town of Shaqlawa.</p>
<p>He gave no figures for KDP casualties.</p>
<p>The PUK said in a statement that two civilians were killed in a KDP attack against the settlement of Pirzin, northeast of the main Iraqi Kurdish city of Arbil.</p>
<p>Clashes between the two groups broke out at the weekend, shattering a U.S.-brokered ceasefire sealed last year.</p>
<p>Iraq's Kurds, protected from possible Iraqi attack by Western air power based in Turkey, broke away from Baghdad after the 1991 Gulf War. Fighting between them began in 1994 and about 3,000 people died in clashes until the ceasefire.</p>
<p>The PUK said it had repulsed offensives by the KDP southeast of Arbil and in the remote mountains near the strategic northeastern town of Rawanduz, close to the Iranian border.</p>
<p>The two militias, rivals for decades, have accused each other of cooperating with Baghdad or Tehran in the recent fighting and blamed each other for the renewed clashes.</p>
