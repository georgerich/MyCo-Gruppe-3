<p>Indonesia will restrict the number of foreign-owned dwellings in an area and regulate the house sizes under new regulations to be issued, the Jakarta Post newspaper said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The newspaper quoted Housing Minister Akbar Tanjung as saying on Wednesday after meeting President Suharto that foreign-owned houses in any given area would be limited to 40 percent to prevent any negative impact on local people.</p>
<p>Government regulations announced in June allowed foreigners living in Indonesia to own one house or apartment for residential purposes for a 25-year period, extendable for another 25-year term.</p>
<p>Tanjung said there would also be restrictions on buying small houses. Foreigners would be allowed to own houses no smaller than 70 square metres, built on a lot between 200 and 2,000 square metres, he said.</p>
<p>Construction value of the houses should exceed 500,000 rupiah ($213) per square metre. Apartments should be above 54 square metres, with a minimum construction value between 600,000 and 700,000 rupiah per square metre.</p>
