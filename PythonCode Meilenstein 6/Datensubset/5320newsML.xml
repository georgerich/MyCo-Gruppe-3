<p>Finnish chemicals and foodstuffs group Raision Tehtaat Oy Ab said in a statement on Wednesday it had found a way to cut the cost of feeding dairy cattle which could be commercially viable in the next few years.</p>
<p>The finding was made in cooperation with the Finnnish agricultural research centre and a patent had been sought.</p>
<p>&quot;The research team ... found that six grammes of histidine had the same effect on production as approximately one kilogramme of protein feed,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>&quot;The discovery can, to some degree, be directly applied to current products using raw material optimisation methods. New product applications are expected to become commercially exploitable over the next few years,&quot; Raisio said.  </p>
<p>Feeding accounts for about 50 percent of the cost of milk production, Raisio said.</p>
<p>&quot;In the event that the price of protected histidine were to more or less equal the price of methionine, another protected amino acid currently on the market, the cost saving in feeding would average one markka per head of cattle per day,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>&quot;This would yield annual savings of 120 million markka in the feeding costs of cattle in Finland alone, and savings of three to five billion markka in the entire EU area,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>Protected amino acids are treated in a way that allows them to pass the rumen (first stomach) in the cow's digestive system without degrading into ammonia, Raisio said.</p>
<p>Raisio's net sales in cattle feed are currently some 250 million markka per year, or some six percent of projected full-year 1996 group sales. Its Finnish market share is more than one third, Raisio said.</p>
