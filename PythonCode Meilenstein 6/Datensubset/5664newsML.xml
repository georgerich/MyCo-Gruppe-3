<p>U.S. Mid-Atlantic spot electricity prices held relatively steady Wednesday, with the exception of next day power which rose on expectations of hot weather Thursday and Friday, industry sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;We're actually going to hit 90 (degrees Fahrenheit) for the first time since June,&quot; said one Houston-based short-term power marketer.</p>
<p>Prices in the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) power pool for next day, on peak delivery, were talked in the $31.00-34.00 range with several unconfirmed trades reported at $33.50, brokers and marketers said.</p>
<p>Next-day PJM was talked at $29.00-31.00 on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Power for the five business days of next week was discussed lower at $24.00-25.00 with unconfirmed trades reported at $25.00, from a range of $24.75-25.50 on Tuesday, sources said. Temperatures were expected to ease next week.</p>
<p>September PJM power, also for firm, peak delivery, was assessed relatively steady in the $22.20-22.75 range with one unconfirmed trade reported at $22.50, the sources said.</p>
<p>October PJM electricity with similar delivery terms was said to have traded at $20.50, steady within Tuesday's range of $20.00-20.65, the sources said.</p>
