<p>China plans to carry out its next satellite launch before the end of the year despite a failure over the weekend, a spokesman for the China Aerospace Corp said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The next launch will depend on the weather...and preparations,&quot; the spokesman said by telephone.</p>
<p>He said no launch contracts had yet been cancelled after the disclosure that a satellite launched on Sunday failed to reach its proper orbit. The cause of the failure was still under investigation, he said.</p>
<p>On Sunday, a domestic communications satellite, launched aboard a Long March 3 rocket from the Xichang space centre in southwest China, went into a lower orbit than planned and was unlikely to be salvaged.</p>
<p>Asked why announcement of the failure was delayed by one day, the spokesman said time was needed to determine if it had actually failed to go into proper orbit.</p>
<p>The Chinapac-7 satellite was built by Hughes Space and Communications Co of the United States, a unit of General Motors Corp.</p>
<p>It was launched for domestic television and telecommunications use by China Telecommunication Broadcasting Satellite Corp, which is under the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. It had an insured value of $120 million.</p>
<p>It was the latest in a string of setbacks that have plagued China's space industry. An Intelsat satellite was destroyed in a spectacular explosion in February when a Long March 3B rocket veered wildly, seconds after lift-off from Xichang, killing six people, injuring 57 and destroying 80 homes.</p>
<p>In January 1995, a Long March rocket blew up, destroying the Apstar 2 satellite and killing six people.</p>
