<title>COMOROS: New government formed in Comoros.</title>
<headline>New government formed in Comoros.</headline>
<dateline>MORONI, Comoro Islands 1996-08-22</dateline>

<p>President Mohamed Taki of the coup-prone Comoro Islands has appointed a new government, dropping his finance and justice ministers who refused to merge their parties into a single ruling party.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Said Ali Kemal was replaced by Dahilou Omar, a close Taki ally and former minister-delegate for the economy and budget, state-run Comoros radio said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Justice Minister Mohamed Abdul Wahab was replaced in the 14-member government announced on Wednesday night by Ali Ben Ali, former minister-delegate for administrative reform.</p>
<p>Parties headed by Wahab and Kemal took a total of 13 percent of the vote in a presidential election in March won by Taki but they had refused to dissolve their parties and join a single ruling party the president is trying to set up, officials said.</p>
<p>The two party leaders were included in the former cabinet as they were needed to balance political factions after an abortive coup last September led by French mercenary Bod Denard.</p>
<p>The only woman in the former cabinet, Minister-Delegate for Posts and Telecommunications Soifa Said Bourhane, was appointed minister-delegate for the economy and domestic trade, the radio said.</p>
<p>Taki summoned ministers at short notice on Wednesday and told them Prime Minister Tajiddine Ben Said Massonde had handed in his resignation and had been asked to form a new government.</p>
<p>The Indian Ocean Comoro Islands have seen up to 17 coups or attempted coups since independence from France in 1975.</p>
