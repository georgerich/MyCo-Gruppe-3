<title>GERMANY: INSTANT VIEW - Two German states report August CPI.</title>
<headline>INSTANT VIEW - Two German states report August CPI.</headline>

<p>Following are comments from economists on the release of two consumer price reports for August from two German states.</p>
<p>The state of Hesse said consumer prices fell 0.1 percent from August for a year-on-year rate of 1.2 percent.</p>
<p>The state of Baden-Wuerttemberg said consumer prices were unchanged for the month and up 1.3 percent year-on-year.</p>
<p>Alfred Rosenstock, IBJ, Frankfurt:</p>
<p>&quot;The numbers so far are very good and are actually a bit better than people had expected. The inflation trend continues to be favourable.&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;It confirms the Bundesbank decision on Thursday to cut the repo rate. Inflation does not even really exist right now and supports calls for even lower interest rates. It looks as though we may be at the bottom but we may sink to one percent. However, there is little chance of going below one percent for a sustained period.&quot;</p>
<p>Matthias Haffner, BZW, Frankfurt:</p>
<p>&quot;The figures are very much in line with what we expected. We are not seeing the effect of travel and tourism figures in August. It seems that inflation continues not to be a worry.&quot;  </p>
<p>Lothar Hessler, bond analyst at Trinkaus &amp; Burkhardt:</p>
<p>&quot;There is no sign of inflation dangers at any level. We expect the west German August rate to be down 0.1 percent month-on-month and up 1.4 percent year-on-year. Administrative prices are developing favourably and high unemployment should preclude wage cost pressures.&quot;</p>
