<p>Syria on Thursday turned down an Israeli offer to resume peace talks &quot;with no preconditions&quot;, saying negotiations could only be based on an Israeli withdrawal from the strategic Golan Heights.</p>
<p>&quot;Syria will never negotiate for the sake of negotiations and will not be dragged into the trap of talks 'with no preconditions' which simply means holding talks that are not based on any principle and allowing (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu to say the Golan is an Israeli land,&quot; the official newspaper Tishreen said.</p>
<p>Israel on Wednesday sent Syria a message, via Washington, saying it was committed to peace and wanted to open negotiations without preconditions. The message came after mounting tension between the two countries.</p>
<p>Another official Syrian daily said that the Israeli offer was putting unacceptable conditions that steer the process away from its previously agreed basis of exchanging land for peace.</p>
<p>&quot;Syria does not put preconditions but the government of Netanyahu is the side that puts conditions...when it demanded to give up the basis of the peace process...and that the Israeli occupation remains on the golan,&quot; the ruling party newspaper al-Baath said.</p>
<p>&quot;If the government of Netanyahu is really interested in entering peace talks within its framework and on its agreed basis, it should enter from the door which Syria has opened, that is to resume talks from the point of last February, when the talks were suspended,&quot; al-Baath added.</p>
<p>Talks between Syria and Israel were suspended following a wave of Moslem suicide attacks in Israel in February and March when Damascus refused to condemn the attacks.</p>
<p>Prospects for the resumption of the talks were dimmed further with the May election of Netanyahu, who has opposed his predecessor's policy of returning conquered Arab land for peace, including the Golan captured in 1967.</p>
<p>Al-Baath warned that if Israel continued to refuse to pull out from the Golan, it would be responsible for the consequences.</p>
<p>&quot;Syria has no condition for peace but to reach the just and comprehensive peace, and if the government of Netanyahu did not enter (talks) from this door, it would carry the responsibility for all the consequences resulting from its policy,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy said on Wednesday that Israel asked Washington to pass a message to Syria that it wanted peace and was ready to begin negotiations without preconditions.</p>
<p>&quot;If Netanyahu was really interested in peace, he would not have abandoned the basis of the peace process, turned his back to the previous Israeli government's commitments and flared up talks about weapons, power balances, wars and armed struggles,&quot; al-Baath said.</p>
<p>Syria and Israel accused each other this week of escalating tension over armament. Israeli television reported on Monday that Damascus had recently test fired a Scud C missile able to hit most cities in the Jewish state.</p>
<p>Israel on Tuesday tested its U.S.-funded Arrow 2 missile, saying it successfully intercepted a target missile.</p>
