<p>Portugal's state utility Electriciade de Portugal (EdP) has awarded a tender to buy a 30,000 tonne heavy fuel oil cargo to Cepsa, traders said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Spanish oil company was understood to have offered at mean of fob Med and mean of fob NWE +$12 a tonne for delivery into Lisbon between August 27-30.</p>
<p>Cepsa was heard looking in the market for product on Wednesday morning and was thought to have been offered material at $98.50 fob Rotterdam.</p>
<p>Traders in the Mediterranean said product was tight in the region and that EdP suitable cargoes were difficult to come by.</p>
<p>One trader expressed surprise that Cepsa had offered for the tender if it did not already hold a cargo since the tender delivery date is prompt. However, other dealers thought the company already had fuel oil to meet EdP's specification.</p>
<p>EdP's tender was additional to the six cargoes it awarded for August delivery.</p>
<p>Another tender, from Tunisia, to buy 100,000 tonnes of fuel oil with a maximum sulphur content of three percent was withdrawn late on Tuesday, traders said.</p>
<p>There had been speculation the tender would not be awarded because offers received by Turkey's Etap were thought to have been unacceptably high. The company has been trying to extend existing term contracts, one trader said.</p>
<p>The tender had been for a September to January delivery period.</p>
