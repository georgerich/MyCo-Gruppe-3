<p>A U.N. mission in Guatemala said on Monday insufficient progress had been made on human rights, as death threats and kidnappings remained unchecked by the country's judiciary and police.</p>
<p>In a report made available to the media on Monday, the U.N. human rights mission also hailed the government's efforts in moving ahead on peace negotiations with leftist rebels.</p>
<p>&quot;The mission highly values the political will of the Guatemalan government and the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unit to leave arms behind and finish with war,&quot; David Stephen, the director of the United Nations Mission for Verification of Human Rights in Guatemala, told reporters.</p>
<p>Stephen presented the report -- the mission's fifth in more than two  years -- to President Alvaro Arzu and commanders of leftist rebels last week.</p>
<p>The mission, in Guatemala since late 1993, investigates allegations of human rights abuses, promotes human rights education and monitors implementation of peace accords to end Guatemala's 36-year civil war.</p>
<p>Stephen told a news conference that Guatemala still had an alarming number of death threats and kidnappings and that the population lacked confidence in the justice system.</p>
<p>Other problems were ineffective courts and security forces and the army's refusal to cooperate with criminal investigations into members of its forces, he added.</p>
<p>The report said that a high percentage of the prison population is composed of persons accused of petty crimes.</p>
<p>&quot;In other, serious cases, however, in which there is evidence pointing to the liabiity of the defendant, release has been granted, generating a lack of confidence in the justice system among the population,&quot; it added.</p>
