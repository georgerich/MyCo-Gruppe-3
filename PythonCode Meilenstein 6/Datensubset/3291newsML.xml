<p>Lithuanian newspapers carried the following reports in their Tuesday editions. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy:</p>
<p>ALL NEWSPAPERS</p>
<p>- The construction of the Butinge oil terminal is strangled by politics and competition.

<p>- Defence Minister Linas Linkevicius submitted his application to the central election commission to be an independent candidate in October's elections. Linkevicius earlier this year defected from the ruling Lithuanian Democratic Labour Party (LDLP).</p>
<p>- The jeep which belongs to one of the suspected leaders of Vilnius Brigade criminal group Viaceslav Zaboronok, nicknamed Kozlik, was blown up in Vilnius Monday morning. Zaboronok was shot two weeks ago and police experts forecast a mob war in the capital.</p>
<p>- The LDLP abandoned its plans to initiate a referendum and gain more powers for the president.</p>

<p>LIETUVOS AIDAS</p>
<p>- The most important thing in creating the new national oil company Lietuvos Nafta is to ensure the decisive influence of the state in the firm, Energy Minister Saulius Kutas told a news conference.

<p>VERSLO ZINIOS</p>
