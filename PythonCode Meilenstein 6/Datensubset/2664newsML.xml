<headline>BASEBALL-RANGERS POUND INDIANS IN BATTLE OF DIVISION LEADERS.</headline>
<dateline>CLEVELAND 1996-08-19</dateline>
<text>
<p>Juan Gonzalez had four RBI and Roger Pavlik threw a four-hitter as the red-hot Texas Rangers pounded the Cleveland Indians 10-3 Monday in the opener of a three-game series between division leaders.</p>
<p>Dean Palmer added a two-run homer, his 29th, and a sacrifice fly for the American League West leaders, who have won nine of their last 10 games.</p>
<p>Pavlik (14-6) walked four and struck out two en route to his seventh complete game, tying him with Toronto's Pat Hentgen for the major-league lead.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a matter of the guys putting up the runs tonight,&quot; said Pavlik. &quot;I just had to put the ball over the plate. I stayed with all my pitches and I just hope we keep this thing rolling.&quot;</p>
<p>Albert Belle hit his 40th homer and drove in two runs for the Indians, who had a three-game winning streak snapped. Belle became the first Indian to hit 40 homers in consecutive seasons since Rocky Colavito in 1958 and 1959.</p>
<p>Jack McDowell (10-8) was hammered for eight runs, eight hits and three walks in three-plus innings.</p>
<p>The Rangers set an A.L. record for consecutive errorless games with 15, surpassing the 1991 California Angels. The major-league mark of 16 was by the 1992 St Louis Cardinals.</p>
<p>Texas leads the season series 5-2 and has won its last four games against the Indians, the A.L. Central leaders.</p>
<p>In New York, Andy Pettitte pitched a three-hitter to become the league's first 18-game winner and Derek Jeter's two-run single snapped a fifth-inning tie as the Yankees salvaged the finale of a four-game series with a 10-4 victory over the Seattle Mariners.</p>
<p>Pettitte (18-7) improved to 11-2 this season when pitching after a New York loss.</p>
<p>Cecil Fielder, Tino Martinez and Bernie Williams homered for the Yankees, who prevented Seattle from completing its first-ever sweep at New York.</p>
<p>Martinez drove in five runs and Fielder had four hits for the Yankees, who won for just the third time in nine home games and snapped a four-game losing streak to Seattle.</p>
<p>Rafael Cormona (6-2) was rocked for six runs and 10 hits in 4 1/3 innings for Seattle, which has lost nine of 13.</p>
<p>For the Mariners, Jay Buhner cracked his 39th homer, a three-run shot.  Buhner, who has 114 RBI, is one behind Belle for the A.L. lead. Alex Rodriguez added his 29th homer.</p>
<p>The four-game series drew 181,216 fans, the most at Yankee Stadium since a four-game set against Boston in September 1993 attracted 192,937.</p>
<p>In Boston, Troy O'Leary's two-run single capped a three-run sixth inning as the Red Sox edged the California Angels 10-9 in a game that featured 31 hits and 11 pitchers.</p>
<p>O'Leary had three hits and three RBI and Reggie Jefferson went 3-for-4 with a homer and two RBI for Boston, which gained a split of the four-game series. Boston has won 12 of 16.</p>
<p>Kerry Lacy (1-0) gave up one unearned run and three hits in one inning for his first major-league victory. Heathcliff Slocumb, the seventh Red Sox pitcher, worked a perfect ninth for his 20th save.</p>
<p>Tim Salmon went 4-for-4 with a solo homer and Jorge Fabregas knocked in a career-high four runs for the Angels.</p>
<p>In Detroit, Ozzie Guillen and Danny Tartabull hit three-run homers in a seven-run ninth inning as the Chicago White Sox rallied for a 12-7 victory over the Tigers.</p>
<p>The Tigers led 7-5 entering the ninth but the White Sox sent 12 batters to the plate. Greg Norton singled twice, getting his first two major-league hits in the same inning.</p>
<p>Chicago has won all eight meetings with the Tigers this season, outscoring them 87-22.</p>
<p>Curtis Pride had a three-run homer and Andujar Cedeno added a two-run shot for the Tigers, who have lost eight in a row after winning 10 of 12.</p>
<p>In Kansas City, Charlie O'Brien's ninth-inning sacrifice fly scored Joe Carter, who had tripled, and Woody Williams and two relievers combined on a six-hitter, giving the Toronto Blue Jays a 2-1 victory over the Royals.</p>
<p>Carter had been 7-for-65 and was hitless in his first three at-bats before his triple.</p>
<p>At Minnesota, Jeff D'Amico (4-5) allowed four hits over a career-high seven innings to snap a personal three-game losing streak and Marc Newfield belted a three-run homer to lead the Milwaukee Brewers to a 6-1 victory over the Twins.</p>
<p>The Brewers have won four of their last five games after losing nine in a row. The Twins had won 10 of their last 12.</p>
