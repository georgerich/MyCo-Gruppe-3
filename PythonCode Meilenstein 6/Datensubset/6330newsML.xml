<p>President Bill Clinton appealed to Russian President Boris Yeltsin on Wednesday to end violence in Chechnya and promote a peaceful dialogue.</p>
<p>&quot;This cycle of violence must come to an end because prolonged fighting is only going to endanger civilians,&quot; White House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters.</p>
<p>Russian forces have been pounding the rebel-held Chechnyan city of Grozny in an effort to crush the guerrilla resistance in the breakaway region.</p>
<p>McCurry said Clinton's letter to Yeltsin was sent overnight and there had not been a response. He said the United States was encouraged that Russian security chief Alexander Lebed was in Chechnya trying to lift the threat of bombardment of Grozny. Truce talks are planned for Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;The humanitarian situation there is very difficult and we continue to call upon all the parties to minimise the conflict, to return to the kinds of discussions that could bring the conflict to an end,&quot; McCurry told reporters.</p>
<p>Asked about Yeltsin's health in the wake of rumours that the Russian leader is seriously ill, McCurry said Washington had no indication that Yeltsin was doing anything but taking a long vacation after his strenuous re-election campaign.</p>
<p>Time magazine reported this week that, according to an official Kremlin medical advisory it had obtained, the president needed round-the-clock monitoring and the Kremlin was considering transferring him to a Swiss clinic for a bypass operation.</p>
<p>&quot;Our assessment,&quot; said McCurry, &quot;is based on the information that we have available that has been communicated publicly by the Russian Federation. He has indicated a desire to take some vacation time after a strenuous campaign period. That doesn't seem to be too unusual.&quot;</p>
<p>McCurry, asked if there was some concern about the balance of power in Russia and Yeltsin's grip on power, said: &quot;It is not my position here to comment on internal political workings of the Russian government.&quot;</p>
<p>He continued: &quot;We maintain proper routine diplomatic contact at a variety of levels with the Russian Federation. We are in regular contact at high levels through our embassy in Moscow.&quot;</p>
