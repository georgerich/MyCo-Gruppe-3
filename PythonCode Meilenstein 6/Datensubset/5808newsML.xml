<headline>LME copper finds support and bounces to end stable.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-08-21</dateline>
<text>
<p>Light bouts of short-covering and speculative buying aided a bounce in copper prices by Wednesday's London Metal Exchange (LME) close, though prices remained firmly entrenched in recent ranges.</p>
<p>Three months delivery rallied from a low of $1,915 to close at $1,936, little moved from Tuesday's LME kerb close of $1,931.</p>
<p>Traders said support around the $1,915/16 continued to hold but noted the recovery from this area have become less pronounced. &quot;In technical terms the bounces from around $1,915 are becoming smaller which is giving a bearish overtone to the market,&quot; one LME trader said.</p>
<p>But he doubted there would be any significant downside pressure ahead of the long U.K. holiday this weekend.</p>
<p>Others agreed saying there was reasonable support from $1,910 down to $1,900.</p>
<p>&quot;Short-term the market remains in a sideways pattern,&quot; one trader commented.</p>
<p>A lack of fundamental news amid the summer slowdown has seen copper in apathetic mood recently, a condition which has seen the nearby spreads dictate market movements.</p>
<p>Earlier the well-watched cash to three months backwardation eased to around a $38 back, before recovering to settle at $41.</p>
<p>This was well below the $100 level that prevailed a month ago, but traders believe the spread has the potential to widen in the near term as the summer lull draws to a close and supplies tighten.</p>
<p>Other metals were also quiet and largely matched the gyrations of the copper contract.</p>
<p>Aluminium held within its $1,480/$1,500 range and was last at $1,490, up $1. Traders said they expected aluminium to consolidate but did not rule out fresh consumer buying in September which could have the potential to move prices higher.</p>
<p>Zinc held lower levels after Tuesday's poor chart close.</p>
<p>It was last at $1,022, against $1,031.</p>
<p>Nickel settled higher at $7,250 on the back of fresh trade and merchant buying. It closed Tuesday at $7,185.</p>
<p>Lead was $4 lower at $820, while tin was down $10 at $6,150.</p>
<p>Alloy was quoted at $1,287/90/, versus $1,280/83.</p>
