<p>Senegal on Wednesday denounced Angola's expulsion of hundreds of African migrants, adding its voice to that of neighbouring Guinea.</p>
<p>&quot;It's inadmissible that measures of this nature are being taken by African states against African nationals whatever the reasons or justification,&quot; the Senegalese Foreign Ministry said in a statement.</p>
<p>Angola said on Friday it had deported 415 immigrants operating unlawful businesses and would expel hundreds more by early this week. A sudden clampdown began on August 12 with 349 citizens of Senegal, Lebanon and Mali being expelled.</p>
<p>A total of 86 Senegalese have been expelled, mostly businessmen. A further 54 are expected home this week.</p>
<p>More than 80 Mauritanians returned home on Tuesday, with some saying they had been badly treated and prevented from saying their Moslem prayers.</p>
<p>Guinean officials said on Monday that 159 expelled Guineans had been mistreated by Angolan security forces and that their papers had been in order.</p>
<p>Senegal has sent Abdoulaye Wade, minister of state to the presidency, to Angola to try to solve the problem of unlawful immigrants.</p>
<p>Senegalese migrant traders are a common sight on streets away from home, whether in Africa, Europe or North America.</p>
