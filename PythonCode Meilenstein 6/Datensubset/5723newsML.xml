<p>Scientists were heading back to the Antarctic ice field where the famed Martian meteorite was discovered 12 years ago with hopes of finding up to 1,000 more, the leader of the U.S. search team said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;We use a superb scientific instrument -- the human eye,&quot; said Ralph Harvey, head of an annual Antarctic hunt funded by the National Science Foundation. &quot;If we see a little black rock lying on this ice, it's probably a meteorite.&quot;</p>
<p>The search will take place this year in the same region where an unprepossessing dark rock designated ALH84001 was found in 1984. After years of study by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the rock was determined to show evidence of possible ancient microscopic life on Mars.</p>
<p>The resulting furor has drawn worldwide attention since NASA announced its findings this month, but Harvey told a news conference it was pure coincidence that his team planned to look in the same area. The complex logistics of polar travel and research mean such expeditions are planned many months or even years in advance, he said.</p>
<p>He was optimistic about the prospects for the 1996 trip: &quot;I'm guessing the numbers (of meteorites recovered) will be very good this year, in the hundreds or possibly up to 1,000.&quot;</p>
<p>The team planned to search an area known as Elephant Moraine for about seven weeks, he said. Some 16,000 meteorites from Mars and the Moon have been found in Antarctica so far, half by Harvey's teams. But the one that showed promise of Martian life was spotted and picked up by Roberta Score.</p>
<p>&quot;I've always thought this rock was kind of special,&quot; Score told the news conference. &quot;I kept telling people, wait'll you see this thing.&quot;</p>
<p>She said she first saw it on Dec. 7, 1984, &quot;just laying on the top of the surface&quot; looking &quot;greenish.&quot; The green cast was not evident when she saw it years later in a U.S. lab and she acknowledged she was wearing dark glasses when she first noticed the rock.</p>
<p>Following customary procedure to minimize contamination, Score said she grabbed the rock with a sterile nylon bag, secured it with tape and sent it by ship on a two-month trip to NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston. NASA researchers began studying the rock in earnest two years ago and published their findings in last week's edition of the journal Science.</p>
<p>Harvey's team disputed NASA's contention that the rock indicated possible Martian life, notably because the NSF team's studies showed little evidence that water -- seen as a pre-condition for Earth-type life -- ever flowed through it.</p>
<p>But he said more study of this rock and others was needed, including thousands of meteorites in Japan's collection.</p>
<p>Dennis Peacock, who heads the NSF's Antarctic Science section, said the discovery of ALH84001 will not necessarily spur research into Martian meteorites, which will depend directly on how much money is set aside for this.</p>
<p>But he stressed that thousands of meteorites were already available and said the analytical effort might be accelerated.</p>
<p>Antarctica is considered a fertile field for meteorite collection not because more meteorites fall there than elsewhere on Earth but because its dry, cold climate preserves them well and its snowy terrain makes these dark rocks easily visible. Also, the movement of the southern ice fields concentrates meteorites in certain known areas.</p>
