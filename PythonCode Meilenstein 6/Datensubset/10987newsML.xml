<p>A surprise cut in South Africa's weekly three-month Treasury Bill tender offering was likely to lead to a lower rate on Friday, a Reserve Bank official and traders said.</p>
<p>The Bank said it was offering only 600 million rand of 91-day bills at the weekly auction -- 300 million rand down from the usual 900 million rand that is on offer.</p>
<p>Roelf du Plooy, assistant general manager at the Reserve Bank's money and capital market division, said the T-Bill rate could ease from last week's 16.19 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;I think people might tender more aggressively because of the lower amount on offer which means that the rate could be a little lower than last week,&quot; Du Plooy said.</p>
<p>Traders, who had yesterday pridcted a slight rise in the rate to 16.20-16.27 assuming a normal offering, said the lower amount meant the rate could come in at around 16 percent.</p>
<p>Du Plooy said central bank had reduced the weekly tender because government finances were &quot;in such good shape that they wanted us to put a little bit less on offer this week&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The government can vary the tender from time to time according to their needs. At this stage they feel that they do not need the extra 300 million. It is just a matter of saving a little bit on their interest payments,&quot; Du Plooy said.</p>
<p>Some money market traders questioned the move, charging that the reduced offering was a bid to manipulate the three-month rate and ease the pressure on Bank Governor Chris Stals to hike Bank rate -- currently at 16 percent.</p>
<p>Du Plooy dismissed the suggestion:</p>
<p>&quot;I see this straightforward...that government needs less money for the week. The whole funding exercise for August has gone substantially well and they feel that collecting more money than they really need will just put more pressure on them for higher interest payments.&quot;</p>
<p>Another trader felt the Bank's move was a bid to reduce speculative play on the tender.</p>
<p>&quot;All they are trying to do is get a more realistic impression out there by cutting the chancers out of the game,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank will announce the results of the tender at 1000 GMT.</p>
