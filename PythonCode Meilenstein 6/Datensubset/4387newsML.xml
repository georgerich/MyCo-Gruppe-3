<title>NETHERLANDS: German M3 has little impact on Dutch money rates.</title>
<headline>German M3 has little impact on Dutch money rates.</headline>
<dateline>AMSTERDAM 1996-08-20</dateline>
<text>
<p>Dutch money rates held broadly steady at Monday's levels in quiet Tuesday trade, despite a slowdown in German M3 money supply growth which heightened speculation of an imminent cut in Germany's repo rate.</p>
<p>Dealers said many players were sidelined as the market looked to the outcome of today's U.S Federal Open Market Committee meeting and Thursday's Bundesbank gathering.</p>
<p>The German central bank said earlier that M3 slowed to an annualised 8.6 percent in July, versus average fourth quarter 1995, from 9.6 percent in June, fuelling expectations of a 10 to 20 basis point cut in Germany's rate, equivalent to the Dutch special advances rate.</p>
<p>But the news generated few ripples on the Dutch money market, where rates have eased recently.</p>
<p>Three-month guilders were quoted down two basis points at 2.94 percent bid, while six month guilders were also two b.p. lower at 2.58 percent bid.</p>
<p>Dealers said overnight guilders were changing hands at an unchanged 2.87 percent.</p>
<p>Activity had been concentrated at the short end of the curve in the wake of the latest special advances allocation of 2.89 billion guilders at an unchanged rate of 2.7 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The allocation was tailor-made to market needs,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>He said the Dutch central bank was not widely expected to follow a German repo rate cut of 10 basis points, but might move in the event of a bigger reduction.</p>
<p>Germany's repo is currently set at 3.30 percent.</p>
<p>The guilder held steady against the mark, quoting at 112.175 guilders per 100 marks which was unchanged from Monday's fixing.</p>
