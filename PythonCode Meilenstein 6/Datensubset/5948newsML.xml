<p>The weakening of the Bulgarian lev reflects insufficient financial discipline, an International Monetary Fund official said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are concerned about the general stance of monetary and fiscal policy. We shall be looking at ways to improve that,&quot; IMF mission leader Anne McGuirk told reporters on arrival at Sofia airport.</p>
<p>&quot;The weakening of the exchange rate suggests that the financial policies may not be tight enough and that is one of the things we will be discussing,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>The stagnant economy, delayed reforms and an acute banking crisis put the lev under pressure earlier this year when it lost 80 percent of its value against the dollar.</p>
<p>It steadied recently at around 190 levs to the dollar, but today it fell to around 199 to the dollar.</p>
<p>&quot;Depreciation of the exchange rate leads to quickening of inflation in this country and that is why we would like to see the rate stabilised,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>The IMF will not recommend pegging the lev at this stage, &quot;it will remain market-determined,&quot; said McGuirk, who will spend two weeks in Sofia reviewing its reform performance in light of an extensive funding agreement approved last month.</p>
<p>The programme unblocked crucial IMF funding support to help Bulgaria meet its big foreign debt commitments.</p>
<p>Bulgaria received the first $115 million tranche last month after sealing a tough reform programme which includes closing scores of loss-making state firms and several insolvent banks, maintaining a tight monetary policy and curbing inflation.</p>
<p>Asked whether the second $115 million tranche of IMF funding might be suspended, McGuirk said  &quot;It is a litle premature to judge because the targets are set for end-September. But the second tranche depends on progress under the programme.&quot; -- Elisaveta Konstantinova, Sofia Newsroom, 359-2-84561</p>
