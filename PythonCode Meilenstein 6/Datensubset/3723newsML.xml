<title>USA: CSCE cocoa ends up sharply on late spec rally.</title>
<headline>CSCE cocoa ends up sharply on late spec rally.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-08-20</dateline>
<text>
<p>CSCE cocoa futures ended sharply higher Tuesday, as a late speculative-led rally triggered buy stops and boosted values some $20 a tonne across-the-board, floor sources said.</p>
<p>But traders said producer selling at the highs trimmed gains, and kept the December contract beneath key resistance at $1,440 a tonne.</p>
<p>Benchmark December cocoa settled up $21 a tonne, to $1,430, after ranging between $1,437 and $1,416. Spot September climbed $19, to $1,379, while the back months gained $16 to $22. Volume was fairly light, at an estimated 4,937 lots.</p>
<p>Cocoa prices bounded higher from the outset, as dealers took their cue from a strong London market. &quot;The market started off strong with London, but it came off highs like London too,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Chartists continued to look toward $1,440 basis December to provide near-term resistance, with buy-stops placed near $1,445. Stiff psychological support was seen at $1,400, with a subsequent level at $1,392.  </p>
<p>One analyst said until updated Ivorian crop estimates emerged near the end of August, the December contract was likely to range between $1,400 and $1,500.</p>
<p>Preliminary forecasts, which pegged the 1996/97 Ivory Coast crop around 800,000 to 900,000 tonnes, have been largely factored into the market, he said, and barring sharp revisions, news from other cocoa producing countries could become the focus.</p>
<p>&quot;The smaller Ivorian crop is well anticipated,&quot; the analyst said. &quot;There are other countries having problems, such as Bahia and Ghana.&quot;</p>
