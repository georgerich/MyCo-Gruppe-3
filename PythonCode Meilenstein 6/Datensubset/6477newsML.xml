<p>South Carolina's Piedmont Municipal Power Agency has planned two autumn refunding issues totaling $450 million in an effort to trim debt costs and shorten the life of its debt, agency officials said Wednesday.</p>
<p>The sales come as the agency recently saw its bond rating trimmed.</p>
<p>Moody's Investors Service Inc downgraded the utility's debt to Baa1 from single-A Monday.</p>
<p>The rating agency cited slow population growth in Piedmont's service area and its high fixed cost of capacity, which it said would impair the joint power agency's ability to compete in the coming deregulated electricity market.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't anticipate it will have a significant effect on pricing,&quot; utility spokeswoman Robin Smith said.</p>
<p>Standard &amp; Poor's Corp had already cut Piedmont's grade to BBB from single-A in September 1995, also citing its ability to compete under deregulation.</p>
<p>Smith said the utility would proceed with a $180 million refunding issue on Sept 5, with J.P. Morgan Securities Inc as bookrunning senior manager.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no savings in that deal. The reason we are doing that is we're going to be refunding mostly non-callable bonds,&quot; said Piedmont investments director John Glover.</p>
<p>The new bonds will be issued with an any-time call if that can be done without exceeding arbitrage limits.</p>
<p>&quot;If we cannot issue those bonds so the yield is below arbitrage, we'll have a one- or two-year call. We'll adjust the call as necessary for the price,&quot; Glover said.</p>
<p>The deal also frees up insurance capacity because the original bonds were insured but the new ones will not be, Glover said.</p>
<p>In October or early November, the utility plans an insured refunding issue of up to $270 million, of which about $170 million will be fixed rate. It will refund 1986 bonds with coupons as high as 7.5 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;These are bonds that hit a call date on Jan 1, 1996, and have been in the money for a good time. The only reasonwere not refunded in January is because we were in the middle of a strategic planning,&quot; Glover said.</p>
<p>The fixed-rate portion will probably consist of two term bonds with long maturities, Glover said.</p>
<p>The utility expects a present value savings of $53 million or 12.2 percent of the refunded bonds on the second deal.</p>
<p>Smith said the utility would also work with legislators to ensure they address stranded costs and public power concerns as the state moves toward deregulation.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe in South Carolina compitition is not going to be here until the next five or 10 years -- open, full retail competition. We feel like we've got some time,&quot; Smith said.</p>
<p>The utility is also working to improve efficiency, modify its cost structure and build a partnership with large industrial customers who will be the first to feel the effects of deregulation, Smith said.</p>
