<p>Sweet crude oil prices in Asia were talked firmer on Friday amid healthy demand while heavier and less sweet grades were steady to weaker, traders said.</p>
<p>The Brent/Dubai October spread narrowed as the Dubai intermonth spreads widened. Traders said four wet Oct lifting Dubai cargoes were traded Thursday, supporting Dubai paper.</p>
<p>A U.S. major acquired three wet Dubai cargoes from a trader and two state oil companies at full-month quotes plus 46 cents, full month quotes plus 46 cents and full month quotes plus 47 cents.</p>
<p>The cargoes are destined for South Africa, trader said.  </p>
<p>A second U.S. major acquired a cargo from a trader at full-month quotes plus 45 cents, traders said.</p>
<p>The news brought the October Brent/Dubai into $1.79/$1.85 from $1.85/$1.95. Brent futures in London Thursday rose 52 cents to settle at $20.72 and were four cents higher Friday.</p>
<p>Intermonth Dubai spreads widened out on Friday. October/November was talked 34/40 cents from 29/32 cents while November/December was assessed at 33/38 cents versus 28/32.</p>
<p>Despite the firmer talk on light sweet grades, Tapis paper was steady with Sept talked $20.90/$21.00 and October at 10 cents backwardation.  </p>
<p>Dealers said the light sweet market was supported by refiner demand for middle distillate grades, production problems on the Australian Cossack field and the strength of dated Brent pushing West African demand back.</p>
<p>Wet Tapis sellers were standing at quotes plus 70 cents, while a major holding a Kutubu cargo held off a bid at quotes minus 40 after buying the cargo at minus 55 last week.</p>
<p>Minas indications fell. Traders said China acquired 200,000 barrels of Minas crude at ICP minus 30 cents, down two/three cents from a Wednesday deal to Japan. --Singapore, N. Fullick (+65 870 3081), J. Oshima, Tokyo (+813 5473-3708)</p>
