<p>The New Zealand dollar ended off its high but still within its new range on Tuesday, with strength in the Australian dollar being the main influence.</p>
<p>The Kiwi ended at US$0.6910/17, down from its opening of 0.6925/32, having traded a 0.6898-33 range.</p>
<p>The Trade-Weighted Index ended steady at 65.51 from 65.54.</p>
<p>The Australian dollar was at US$0.7885/90, also off its high for the day, but still a big improvement on Monday's 0.7854/59 close.  </p>
<p>&quot;Overall it's well-bid on the back of the Australian dollar's strength,&quot; said one dealer, adding renewed Samurai interest, plus pre-budget buying, were the main drivers.</p>
<p>In the New Zealand dollar, Asian buying was acting as a key support.</p>
<p>The sale by the Government of Forestry Corp -- its second largest privatisation -- did little to move the currency.</p>
<p>Support for the Kiwi is expected at 0.6900 but formidable resistance was seen building at 0.6940.</p>
<p>&quot;It looks pretty dangerous at 0.6940 so it might spike higher if it breaks that level,&quot; he said.</p>
