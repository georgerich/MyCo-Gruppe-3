<p>Germany's Agriculture Ministry suggested on Wednesday that consumers avoid eating meat from British sheep until scientists determine whether mad cow disease can be transmitted to the animals.</p>
<p>&quot;Until this is cleared up by the European Union's scientific panels -- and we have asked this to be done as quickly as possible -- (consumers) should if at all possible give preference to sheepmeat from other countries,&quot; ministry official Werner Zwingmann told ZDF television.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not want to say that there is a concrete danger for consumers,&quot; he added. &quot;There are too many holes in what we know, and these must be filled very quickly.&quot;</p>
<p>Bonn has led efforts to ensure consumer protection tops the list of priorities in dealing with the mad cow crisis, which erupted in March when Britain acknowledged humans could contract a similar illness by eating contaminated beef.</p>
<p>The European Commission agreed this month to rethink a proposal to ban the use of suspect sheep tissue after some EU veterinary experts questioned whether it was justified.</p>
<p>EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler had proposed banning sheep brains, spleens and spinal cords from the human and animal food chains after reports from Britain and France that under laboratory conditions sheep could contract Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) -- mad cow disease.</p>
<p>But some members of the EU's standing veterinary committee questioned whether the action was necessary given the slight risk to human health. The question is being studied separately by two EU scientific committees.</p>
<p>Sheep have long been known to contract scrapie, a similar brain-wasting disease to BSE which is believed to have been transferred to cattle through feed containing animal waste.</p>
<p>British officials say sheep meat is perfectly safe to eat.</p>
<p>ZDF said Germany imported 47,600 sheep from Britain last year, nearly half of total imports. It brought in 4,275 tonnes of British mutton, some 10 percent of overall imports.</p>
<p>After the British government admitted a possible link between mad cow disease and its fatal human equivalent, the EU imposed a worldwide ban on British beef exports.</p>
<p>EU leaders agreed at a summit in June to a progressive lifting of the ban as Britain takes parallel measures to eradicate the disease.</p>
