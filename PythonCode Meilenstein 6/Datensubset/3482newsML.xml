<p>The Australian Labor Party, which is the largest opposition party in the Senate, would vote against an increase in university fees announced in the budget for 1996/97, Labor Treasury spokesman Gareth Evans said.</p>
<p>The increased Higher Education Contribution Scheme (HECS) charges were projected to save A$1.77 billion over the next four years. &quot;HECS will do for a start,&quot; Evans told Australian Broadcasting Corp television, when asked what his party would block in the Senate.</p>
<p>Labor would need support from minor parties to block legislation.  </p>
<p>Evans would not specify which other budget measures Labor would vote against. But he repeated his pledge not to block spending bills, known as supply bills.</p>
<p>&quot;We're pledged not to block supply,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>New revenue measures often require separate legislation which would have to pass the Senate, which is controlled by the Labor Party and the left-leaning Green and Australian Democrat parties when they vote together. Treasurer Peter Costello said earlier on Tuesday that there were some measures in the budget which could be knocked back by the Senate.  </p>
<p>Earlier on Tuesday, Labor senator Mal Colston resigned from the Labor party and was elected deputy president of the Senate with the support of the Liberal/National coalition government.</p>
<p>&quot;It adds further complication to an already complicated management situation in the Senate,&quot; Evans said.</p>
<p>Treasurer Costello delivered a budget forecasting an underlying deficit of A$5.65 billion in the year to June 30, 1997, including A$3.9 billion of budget deficit cuts.</p>
