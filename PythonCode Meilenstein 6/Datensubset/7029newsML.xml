<p>Freight forwarders still object to key elements of new U.S. air cargo security rules, the U.S. Airforwarders Association executive director James Foster said.</p>
<p>Foster told Reuters in a telephone interview that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) had made some changes in recent days but did not satisfy the forwarders' principal objections.</p>
<p>The FAA said on Tuesday that it would implement the new rules on August 28, 12 days later than originally planned.</p>
<p>The rules, a response to the ValuJet and TWA tragedies, were set to take effect originally on August 16, but the FAA suspended their implementation amid a barrage of criticism from forwarders, consolidators and shippers.</p>
<p>The cargo community said the new rules created an additional paperwork burden, would slow the flow of cargo and would not appreciably improve security.</p>
<p>&quot;They have made a few changes, but the paperwork objection still stands as well as the objection to the wording,&quot; said Foster.</p>
<p>The regulations specify that shippers must produce two pieces of photo identification when making a shipment and certify in writing that it does not contain explosives or destructive or dangerous materials.</p>
<p>The documentation must be kept on file by the forwarder or carrier until after the safe arrival of the shipment at its final destination.</p>
<p>Many shippers and forwarders have denounced this as excessively bureaucratic, says Foster.</p>
<p>&quot;It doesn't really seem to serve a purpose,&quot; he said. &quot;It is fairly objectionable to the shipper the way things are worded.&quot;</p>
<p>He said many forwarders believe the existing security measures are sufficient to protect the commercial air cargo stream.</p>
<p>&quot;We feel this was an over-reaction to circumstances that really haven't been shown to have anything to do with commercial cargo.&quot;</p>
<p>Under existing U.S. security rules, freight forwarders can accept shipments only from known companies. Forwarders and shippers say it is unlikely that the additional requirement for photo ID will stop a terrorist, only leave a longer paper trail for investigators to follow after a tragedy.</p>
<p>Foster said there also is a concern that the new rules will slow processing of air freight.</p>
<p>&quot;When you slow it down, you reduce the value in shipping by air,&quot; he added.</p>
