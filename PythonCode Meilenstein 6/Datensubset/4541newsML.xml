<title>NEW ZEALAND: NZ's ASB raises profit, market share.</title>
<headline>NZ's ASB raises profit, market share.</headline>
<dateline>WELLINGTON 1996-08-20</dateline>
<text>
<p>New Zealand's ASB Bank Ltd said on Tuesday its after-tax operating profit rose 9.8 percent to NZ$71.8 million for the year to June 30.</p>
<p>Total advances rose 28.8 percent to $7.6 billion, the third consecutive year that ASB has achieved a rise of more than 20 percent.  </p>
<p>ASB said its share of the retail banking market was 14 percent, an increase of about half over five years.</p>
<p>ASB is 75 percent owned by Commonwealth Bank of Australia, in which the Australian government has sold down its majority stake to the private sector, and 25 percent by the ASB Bank Community Trust.</p>
<p>As a result of the CBA ownership change, ASB converted NZ$231.8 million in revenue reserves into paid-up capital by way of a special dividend.  </p>
<p>The revenue reserves carried imputation credits which could otherwise have been lost to shareholders as CBA's shareholding changed.</p>
<p>New home loans for the year totalled NZ$2.5 billion, up 43.6 percent. Total deposits at year-end stood at $8.2 billion, up 21.3 percent.</p>
<p>Operating income rose 10.1 percent to $348.6 million while operating expenses rose 8.8 percent to $228.2 million.</p>
<p>Return on shareholders' funds slipped to 16.5 percent from 17.7 percent and risk-weighted capital adequacy was 9.6 percent versus 9.7 percent.  </p>
<p>Tax rose to $39.3 million from $35.8 million in 1995, while provision for bad and doubtful debts was up $5.0 million at $34.7 million. This was made up of $3.6 million in specific provisions and $31.1 million (up from $24.0 million) as a general provision.</p>
<p>Ordinary dividends of $14.3 million (up from $13.2 million) and preference dividends of $1.6 million were paid or provided for in the result.  </p>
<p>ASB said it was likely high interest rates would prevail in the first six months of the current financial year which began on July 1, dampening demand from business and personal borrowers.</p>
<p>&quot;While business growth in the current financial year will undoubtedly be more modest than achieved in 1995/96, ASB Bank is looking forward to another successful year,&quot; it said.</p>
