<p>Middlesbrough's Italian striker Fabrizio Ravanelli is to wear his team sponsor's name on the inside of his shirt so it can be seen when he scores.</p>
<p>Every time he finds the net, the grey-haired forward pulls his shirtfront over his head as he runs to salute the fans, and Middlesbrough's sponsors want to cash in on the spectacle.</p>
<p>&quot;Having seen Ravanelli celebrate his goals...we thought it would be fun to have (the name) on the inside of his shirt,&quot; a spokesman for the sponsors said.</p>
<p>&quot;It will give the fans something else to look at besides his chest.&quot;  </p>
<p>Ravanelli aggravated a foot injury in the 1-0 defeat at Chelsea on Wednesday and was given only an even chance of playing at Nottingham Forest on Saturday by his manager Bryan Robson.</p>
