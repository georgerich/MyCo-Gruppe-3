<p>The explosion that brought down TWA Flight 800 occurred in the centre fuel tank area, the lead investigator into the disaster told a television interviewer on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Robert Francis, vice chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, told Cable News Network there was no definitive evidence whether a bomb, missile or mechanical fault caused the Boeing 747 to explode into pieces and crash into the Atlantic Ocean off Long Island July 17, killing all 230 people on board.</p>
<p>&quot;We're certainly saying that there was an explosion in that centre tank area,&quot; he said. &quot;I guess I wouldn't be more specific than that, but clearly there is damage to indicate that now.&quot;</p>
<p>Two weeks ago Francis said investigators were most interested in the middle section and engineers would rebuild that part first. The area stretched from the aft part of the front of the plane to just behind the wings.</p>
<p>The remains of two more victims were recovered from the ocean in the past three days, bringing the total of those retrieved to 208, Francis said.</p>
<p>The flight abruptly ended 11.5 minutes after taking off from New York for Paris.</p>
<p>Francis also said in the CNN interview that the noise heard on the cockpit voice recorder was unlike the noise detected when Pan Am 103 blew up over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988 or in other aircraft disasters.</p>
<p>Francis said experts in Washington did not expect to learn anything more from the cockpit voice recorder or the flight data recorder.</p>
