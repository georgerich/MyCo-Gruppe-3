<p>Syria accused Israel on Thursday of putting unacceptable preconditions on resuming peace talks that steer the process away from its previously agreed basis of exchanging land for peace.</p>
<p>&quot;Syria does not put preconditions but the government of (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu is the side that puts conditions...when it demanded to give up the basis of the peace process...and that the Israeli occupation remains on the Golan,&quot; the ruling party newspaper al-Baath said.</p>
<p>&quot;If the government of Netanyahu is really interested in entering peace talks within its framework and on its agreed basis, it should enter from the door which Syria has opened, that is to resume talks from the point of last February, when the talks were suspended,&quot; al-Baath added.</p>
<p>Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy told Israel radio on Wednesday that Israel asked Washington to pass a message to Syria that it wanted peace and was ready to begin negotiations without preconditions.</p>
<p>Talks between Syria and Israel were suspended following a wave of Moslem suicide attacks in Israel in February and March when Damascus refused to condemn the attacks.</p>
<p>Prospects for the resumption of the talks were dimmed further with the May election of Netanyahu, who has publicly opposed his predecessor's policy of returning conquered Arab land for peace.</p>
