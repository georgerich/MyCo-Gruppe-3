<title>UK: European rate moves make new UK cut more likely.</title>

<p>Thursday's interest rate cuts across continental Europe make it marginally more likely that Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke will cut rates again.</p>
<p>But economists said favourable domestic data will remain the main factor determining whether Clarke cuts rates for the fifth time since last December, either at the September 4 monetary meeting or in October.</p>
<p>Following the Bundesbank's unexpectedly large repo rate cut which triggered moves elsewhere, the short sterling strip has shifted upwards as it reassessed the future path of UK rates.</p>
<p>September and December futures, at 94.27 and 94.28, are now at least starting to think about another quarter-point rate cut, although they still discount unchanged rates.</p>
<p>March 1997 short sterling has changed its tune more dramatically and is no longer fully factoring in a rate rise by the first quarter. It is trading at 94.08 compared with 93.92 on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The (July) retail sales figures helped to spark off a rally in short sterling and this was reinforced by news of a 30 bp reduction in the German repo rate,&quot; said Philip Shaw of Union Discount.</p>
<p>&quot;Nevertheless, UK markets are still reluctant to price in fully a further easing in monetary policy.&quot;</p>
<p>Retail sales unexpectedly fell 0.6 percent in July.</p>
<p>&quot;I think trends in European rates are fairly marginal in Clarke's decision, but yesterday's moves will have helped him slightly,&quot; said James McKay, international economist at Paine Webber.</p>
<p>&quot;I have a feeling he will focus on what he has been focussing on in the past half-year -- falling inflation and falling manufacturing output. I suspect a rate cut may well happen in September. If not, the focus will turn to October.&quot;</p>
<p>Data in the last month are generally seen as having gone Clarke's way in his disagreement with Bank of England Governor Eddie George over the future course of monetary policy.</p>
<p>Alongside the fall in retail sales, second-quarter GDP data showed manufacturing flat and overall growth below-trend, while both retail and producer prices remain benign.</p>
<p>However, Paul Turnbull of Merrill Lynch believes continued evidence of rising final demand will prompt the Chancellor to leave rates where they are.</p>
<p>Turnbull, who fears the economy could overheat next year with growth around four percent, points to a firm trend in retail sales, despite the July fall, and strong business surveys.</p>
<p>Second-quarter GDP, which grew 1.8 percent year-on-year, is fairly buoyant if the problems of the stock cycle are excluded, he argues.</p>
<p>Jonathan Loynes of HSBC Midland says the Confederation of British Industry's monthly trends survey for August, released overnight, shows a glimmer of hope for manufacturers but improvement in the coming months is likely to be slow.</p>
<p>&quot;The twin evils of weak overseas demand and high stocks are still in evidence and could continue to depress output for a while longer,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Shaw of Union Discount said the retail sales numbers strengthen his belief that UK rates have still not bottomed.</p>
<p>A general election is due by May 1997.</p>
