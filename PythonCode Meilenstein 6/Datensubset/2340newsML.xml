<p>The U.S. trade gap narrowed dramatically in June as imports of merchandise and petroleum plunged from May levels, the Commerce Department said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The monthly deficit dropped 23.1 percent to $8.11 billion from a revised $10.55 billion in May -- much lower than the $9.4 billion shortfall that Wall Street economists had forecast for June.</p>
<p>June exports eased a slight 0.3 percent to $69.71 billion while imports dropped 3.3 percent to $77.82 billion.</p>
<p>Amid the big overall improvement in June trade, China emerged for the first time as the nation with which the United States has the largest bilateral shortfall.</p>
<p>The deficit with China climbed 8.8 percent to $3.33 billion in June, surpassing the $3.24 billion deficit with Japan that was up 3.6 percent from May.</p>
<p>Commerce noted that exports of American-made goods to China declined for a fourth straight month in June, which is likely to fuel trade tensions between the two countries.</p>
<p>Steady improvement in shrinking the deficit with Japan was the main reason that China became the leading deficit nation in June, Commerce officials said. The second-quarter deficit of $10.5 billion with Japan was the smallest quarterly deficit in five years, the department said.</p>
<p>Previously, the department said the overall May trade deficit was $10.88 billion but it revised that down to a $10.55 billion gap.</p>
<p>The United States typically runs a surplus on its trade with other countries in services like travel and tourism that partly offsets big merchandise trade deficits.</p>
<p>In June, the merchandise deficit fell 13.9 percent to $14.46 billion from $16.79 billion in May. Lower imports of new cars and parts, especially from Japan and Germany, helped shrink the merchandise trade gap.</p>
<p>The surplus on services climbed 1.6 percent to $6.34 billion from $6.25 billion in May. Analysts said beforehand that an influx of tourists bound for the Olympic Games in Atlanta would boost the services surplus.</p>
<p>The cost and volume of all types of petroleum products fell in June after a sharp May runup. The cost of petroleum imports declined to $5.33 billion in June from $5.93 billion while the volume fell to 291,866 barrels from 305,171 in May.</p>
<p>Foreign sales of civilian aircraft declined in June by $117 million to $1.54 billion. Exports of industrial supplies and materials were off $138 million to $12.32 billion.</p>
<p>Imports of autos and parts from all sources dropped sharply by $689 million to $10.79 billion in June. Computer imports were down $413 million to $4.24 billion and semiconductor imports decreased $291 million to $2.87 billion in June.</p>
<p>In bilateral trade, the deficit with Western Europe fell 7.1 percent to $761 million and the shortfall with Canada was down 2.2 percent to $2.42 billion.</p>
<p>In trade with Mexico, the U.S. deficit shrank 6.4 percent to $1.49 billion amid signs the Mexican economy was recovering from a deep recession and grew solidly in the second quarter this year.</p>
<p>The deficit with oil-producing OPEC countries dropped 26.9 percent in June to $1.40 billion from $1.91 billion in May.</p>
