<p>Leading Russian shares fell on Wednesday in small volumes on worries over President Boris Yeltsin's health, traders said.</p>
<p>They forecast the fall will continue in the next few days.</p>
<p>The Russian Trading System index of 21 leading issues fell by 3.37 percent to 175.88.</p>
<p>&quot;The market got sick, most probably on the reports about Yeltsin's sickness,&quot; said Alexei Dolgikh, chief trader from Troika-Dialog brokerage.</p>
<p>Prices started falling on Tuesday on a report in the U.S. magazine Time that Yeltsin needs round-the-clock monitoring and the Kremlin was considering sending him to a Swiss hospital for a bypass operation.</p>
<p>Yeltsin aides deny he is ill, and said he was resting in Russia's north-western lakeland. Interfax news agency said Yeltsin was returning to the Moscow area on Wednesday and would be back to the Kremlin on Thursday. But a Kremlin spokesman said he could not confirm the report.</p>
<p>Peter Kizenko, head of sales and trading at ING-bank, said that despite the fall in prices there were still buyers on the market.</p>
<p>&quot;Buyers are staying on the market -- they are interested in even lower prices,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Dolgikh said prices would most likely fall further on Thursday. &quot;It is a very quiet day,&quot; he said. &quot;Prices are falling on small volumes.&quot;</p>
<p>Mosenergo closed at $0.95 after $0.96 on Tuesday, UES fell to $0.0765 from $0.0795, LUKoil fell to $9.40 from $9.75 and Norilsk Nickel was $7.50 after $7.70.</p>
