<p>Suleiman Khadzhimuradov, a middle-aged Chechen fighter, didn't have the thousands of dollars he needed for an anti-aircraft weapon. So with some enterprise and creativity, he made his own.</p>
<p>The long silver rocket he lugs around over his shoulder, several inches (cm) taller than he is, was actually salvaged from a downed Russian &quot;crocodile&quot; attack helicopter.</p>
<p>The choppers normally carry several of the deadly charges, which have menaced the guerrillas and killed countless civilians in the 20-month war between Russian troops and the separatists, battling to carve out an independent homeland.</p>
<p>Suleiman, typical of rebel resourcefulness and cunning in the face of the massive firepower of the Russian army, has now aimed the gun the other way.</p>
<p>&quot;When a helicopter is coming in at low altitude it's not so difficult to bring it down with one of these,&quot; he says, wearing a white Moslem cap.</p>
<p>&quot;Each time we can shoot one we get a chance to salvage more of them. They can easily take out a tank too,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>Suleiman has added a handmade wooden handle to the bottom of the rocket to hold it in position while firing. Not made to be fired by hand, the flame from the blast can incinerate its user.</p>
<p>&quot;You have to wear this or you can be burned up instantly,&quot; he says, showing a thick rubber mask with flameproof material on the outside.</p>
<p>The rebels claim to have shot down at least nine Russian helicopters since they launched a massive assault on the capital Grozny two weeks ago. They still control almost all of the city.</p>
<p>Suleiman says that several helicopters have been brought down with the help of rockets like his.</p>
<p>The gutsy tactics help explain the ineffectiveness of the Russian army throughout the conflict, despite having unlimited air power, thousands of pieces of armour, and a manpower advantage of perhaps 10 to one against the rebels.</p>
<p>The Chechens have no air force, perhaps a couple of dozen tanks and other heavy armour and a few artillery pieces. Most rely on simple Kalashnikov rifles or grenade launchers, while some are lucky enough to carry ageing sub-machine guns.</p>
<p>The rockets are just part of an array of makeshift weapons and improvised strategies which have strengthened their arsenal.</p>
<p>Some rebels say they unscrew the nosecones of the shells on their grenade launchers and pour in powdered red pepper.</p>
<p>&quot;If the shrapnel doesn't get them then the pepper stings their eyes and blinds them temporarily,&quot; said Abrel, another fighter.</p>
<p>Others stuff the back of the launchers with tightly wound cotton material. The effect of the trapped gases works like a turbocharger, making the shell fly further, but the launcher can also blow up in the hands of the user.</p>
<p>Another story is how late rebel leader Dzhokhar Dudayev repeatedly pulled dummy surface-to-air missiles through parades in Grozny, thus tricking the Russians into overestimating his firepower.</p>
