<p>The United States welcomed the deal reached on Thursday between Russian authorities and Chechen rebels to end the fighting in Chechnya and said it hoped it would lead to a political settlement.</p>
<p>&quot;We welcome this agreement. It's a very positive step forward. We look forward to its implementation by both of the parties and hope it leads eventually to a political settlement to the Chechen crisis,&quot; State Department spokesman Glyn Davies told reporters.</p>
<p>Davies said the agreement, reached by Russian President Boris Yeltsin's security supremo Alexander Lebed and Chechen rebel chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov at a village south of the Chechen capital Grozny, included a ban on all hostilities.</p>
<p>They also agreed to a partial pullout of forces from Grozny, to set up joint military police patrols in the devastated city and to list the permanent locations of their warring forces as well as routes and deadlines for the troop pullout, he said.</p>
<p>In Moscow, Interfax news agency said a ceasefire would take effect from midday on Friday.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands have died since Moscow sent troops and armour in December 1994 to quell Chechnya's independence bid. A series of attempts to end fighting have collapsed as the sides could not agree on the future of the mountainous region.</p>
<p>The separatists seek full independence from Moscow, which wants Chechnya to remain part of the Russia Federation.</p>
<p>Davies said it was too early to know whether the deal was more promising than an accord on June 10 that failed to stop the fighting.</p>
<p>Chechnya has been a major irritant in relations between Russia and the United States, which has criticised Kremlin attempts to resolve the problem by force.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the State Department condemned threats by a Russian military commander, Gen. Konstantin Pulikovsky, to start an all-out assault on Grozny unless the rebels left.</p>
