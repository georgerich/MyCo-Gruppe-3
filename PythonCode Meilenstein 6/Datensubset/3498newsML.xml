<p>Following are the main features of the Australian government's 1996/97 (July/June) budget announced by Treasurer Peter Costello on Tuesday:</p>
<p>* A forecast underlying budget deficit of A$5.65 billion and a headline budget surplus of A$474 million for 1996/97, compared with deficits of A$10.3 billion and A$5 billion respectively for 1995/96.</p>
<p>* GDP-A, the average measure of economic growth, is forecast to average 3.5 percent growth over 1996/97.  </p>
<p>* CPI is forecast to average two percent over 1996/97. The Treasury's underlying measure of inflation is projected to average 2.75 percent over the same period.</p>
<p>* Australia's current account deficit is predicted to total A$20 billion, or four percent of GDP, in 1996/97.</p>
<p>* Treasurer Peter Costello said the fiscal tightening was needed to enhance Australia's domestic savings performance and pull the nation back from a dangerous level of exposure to shifts in international sentiment.  </p>
<p>* Budget measures to boost the bottom line by A$3.9 billion in 1996/97, rising to A$7.2 billion in the following fiscal year.</p>
<p>* Of the 1996/97 savings, A$1.0 billion comes from net revenue gains and the remaining A$2.9 billion from net spending cuts. The biggest savings are to be made from labour market programmes, higher university student fees and cuts to the bureaucracy.  </p>
<p>* Outlays, excluding asset sales and debt repayments by the states, are projected to steady at A$135.8 billion in 1996/97, against A$132 billion the year before. The proposed sale of a third of state-owned telecommunications carrier Telstra has been included in the 1997/98 and 1998/99 budget forecasts, but no estimate of the expected proceeds were given.</p>
<p>* Election commitments are predicted to cost a total of A$1.5 billion in 1996/97 and A$2 billion in 1997/98. They include incentives for private health insurance and tax breaks for families on low incomes.  </p>
<p>* Revenue is projected to rise by four percent to A$130 billion in 1996/97.</p>
<p>* New revenue-raising measures include a crackdown on tax avoidance and tax minimisation, as well as a tax surcharge on the superannuation savings of high-income earners.</p>
