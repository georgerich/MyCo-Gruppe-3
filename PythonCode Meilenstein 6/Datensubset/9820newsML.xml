<headline>India says sees no arms race with China, Pakistan.</headline>
<dateline>NEW DELHI 1996-08-22</dateline>

<p>India said on Thursday that its opposition to a global nuclear test ban treaty did not mean New Delhi intended to enter into an arms race with neighbouring Pakistan and China.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister I.K. Gujral was asked at a news conference if India's decision to block adoption of the accord in Geneva would lead to an arms race with Pakistan and China.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't see that possibility because India is not entering into any arms race,&quot; he said. &quot;Our not signing a new treaty does not mean we are going in for any new kind of weapons, particularly nuclear.&quot;</p>
<p>China, along with Britain, France, Russia and the United States, is a declared nuclear power. India carried out a nuclear test in 1974 but says it has not built the bomb.</p>
<p>Experts believe both India and Pakistan could quickly assemble nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>Gujral said he did not expect India's veto of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) to damage bilateral ties with other nations.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not visualise its straining our bilateral relations with any country. The text has already been blocked,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Gujral said India would re-examine its position if the treaty, particularly a clause providing for its entry into force, was modified.</p>
<p>Asked what India would do if the pact were forwarded to the United Nations General Assembly, Gujral said: &quot;That bridge I will cross when I come to it.&quot;</p>
<p>In a written statement released at the news conference, Gujral reiterated India's objections to the treaty, under negotiation at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a sad fact that the nuclear weapon states show no interest in giving up their nuclear hegemony,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>Gujral said India had national security concerns that made it impossible for New Delhi to sign the CTBT.</p>
<p>&quot;Our security concerns oblige us to maintain our nuclear option,&quot; he said, adding that India had exercised restraint in not carrying out any nuclear tests since the country's lone test blast in 1974.</p>
<p>He said: &quot;We cannot accept constraints on our option as long as nuclear weapon states continue to rely on their nuclear arsenals for their security&quot;.</p>
