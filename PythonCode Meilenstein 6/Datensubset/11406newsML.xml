<p>A U.S. Marine aircraft on a routine training mission with a crew of four on board crashed near Yuma on Friday, an official said.</p>
<p>Marine spokesman Christopher Tessier said the plane went down west of the Gila mountain range in an area inaccessible to vehicles. The fate of the four-man crew was not immediately known, though the wreckage of the EA6B Prowler jet had been located from the air, he said.</p>
<p>It was the third U.S. military plane crash in two days.</p>
<p>A Marine reserve F/A-18 fighter attack plane crashed into the Atlantic on Thursday and the pilot was missing. Hours later an Air National Guard A-10 tankbuster crashed less than 100 miles (160 km) away and the pilot was taken to hospital.</p>
<p>The plane that went down on Friday was visiting the Yuma Marine Corps Air Station from a Marine air station at Cherry Point, North Carolina, officials said.</p>
