<p>Pakistani authorities issued flood warnings for Punjab province on Friday as heavy rain virtually paralysed the provincial capital Lahore.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Flood Forecasting Bureau in Lahore said the Ravi and Chenab rivers were in exceptionally high flood at several points after heavy rain in catchment areas.</p>
<p>&quot;The rains in the upper and lower catchment area have not stopped for the last 36 hours,&quot; the spokesman said, adding that the department had warned all concerned government agencies.</p>
<p>In Lahore, witnesses said life had come to a near-standstill after heavy rain left water up to one metre (three feet) deep. Motor vehicles could not be used and only horse-drawn carriages and wagons were on the streets.</p>
<p>The Meteorological Department said 164 mm (almost 6-1/2 inches) of rain had fallen in Lahore in the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>This means the city received more rain in a single day than Pakistan's average rainfall of 140 mm (5-1/2 inches) during the whole of the three-month monsoon season. Officials said they were checking whether this had broken previous records.</p>
<p>&quot;I've never seen anything like it in 50 years,&quot; said Tahir Mashadi, 70, stranded at home like most Lahore residents.</p>
<p>There were no immediate reports of any casualties or damage.</p>
<p>Last year floods inundated parts of Pakistan, damaging thousands of houses, destroying crops and killing cattle.</p>
