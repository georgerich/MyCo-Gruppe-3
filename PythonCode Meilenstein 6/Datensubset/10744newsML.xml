<p>U.S. September Standard and Poor's 500 futures finished down moderately but above the session's low, relieved once Treasury bond futures closed.</p>
<p>T-bonds kept pressure on stocks all day, and once September T-bond futures settled for the week, stocks drifted up from their lows.</p>
<p>&quot;We were really just following the bonds in here,&quot; an S&amp;P 500 futures trader said. &quot;Locals have been really out of the market so any sort of move is exacerbated by the lack of volume,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Other traders noted that volume on Friday's sell-off did not appear to be as brisk as activity on Thursday's rally to seven-week highs.</p>
<p>The dim tone was set early by a stronger than expected U.S. July durable goods report that sent September Treasury bond futures through key support and to the lowest price since early August.</p>
<p>Durable goods rose 1.6 percent compared with a forecast for a 0.3 percent rise and a revised 0.2 percent decline in June. Excluding defense, orders rose 3.5 percent in July.  </p>
<p>Traders said the market appeared rather non-committal heading into next week. September S&amp;P 500 futures retreated from Thursday's seven-week high but managed to close in the middle of the day's range. September posted an inside day on bar charts, a technical signal of indecision.</p>
<p>In Nikkei 225 futures, spread activity was seen early but activity overall was thin, traders said.  </p>
<p>September S&amp;P 500 futures ended down 3.05 points to 668.80, Nikkei 225 futures ended down 175.0 points to 21,230.0, Russell 2000 futures posted a 0.60-point gain to 332.20, NYSE Composite index fell 1.65 points to 357.90, Value Line lost 2.40 points to 621.40 and MidCap 400 fell 0.95 to 232.95. -Derivatives Desk, (312) 408-8750;E-mail:derivatives@reuters.com</p>
