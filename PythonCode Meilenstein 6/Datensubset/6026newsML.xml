<p>Anxiety over President Boris Yeltsin's health and a possible upsurge of violence in Chechnya unsettled Russian markets on Wednesday but analysts said the impact was muted, with investors used to volatility in Russia.</p>
<p>Leading Russian shares, which fell 2.31 percent on Tuesday, eased further on Wednesday. Traders said this was mainly due to profit-taking but that Yeltsin's health was a background worry.</p>
<p>&quot;Everybody is concerned about it. Western investors are very concerned but are staying on the sidelines. Nobody is panicking, nobody is selling into this very much,&quot; said Nick Mokhoff, head trader at Alliance-Menatep.</p>
<p>Yeltsin has not been seen in public since August 9. His press service has said he is on holiday in northwestern Russia and has consistently denied rumours he is ill.</p>
<p>&quot;I am firmly convinced that he is alive. He has been signing decrees,&quot; a spokesman said.</p>
<p>In Yeltsin's absence, the powerful Security Council cast doubt on the authenticity of a presidential order on Chechnya on Tuesday, raising questions about who was running the country.</p>
<p>Council Secretary Alexander Lebed was planning to visit the breakaway region on Wednesday to avert a threatened major assault by Russian forces on rebel positions.</p>
<p>But Gavin Rankin, head of research at Troika-Dialog, said he did not believe there was a sense of a power vacuum and that Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's government was in control.</p>
<p>He said the stock market fell sharply in early July on false rumours Yeltsin was dead but had since recovered.</p>
<p>&quot;It is business as usual. Our experience is that Russian presidents can be kept alive a very long time,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Equity prices rose sharply in the run-up to Yeltsin's July 3 election victory and many analysts had forecast further climbs.</p>
<p>But prices slumped until the end of July, partly on worry over Yeltsin's health and after the International Monetary Fund's delayed payment of the July tranche of a $10 billion three-year loan.</p>
<p>The IMF board is due to discuss the release of the cash on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Mokhoff said the market had already discounted a positive decision by the IMF's board and said all the good news which could affect stocks was out.</p>
<p>&quot;At this point, I would probably be more hesitant to be a buyer than a seller short-term,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Tad Berger, senior equity analyst at Creditanstalt-Grant, said concern over Yeltsin had affected markets slightly but the impact was limited. &quot;It is the same stories people have heard before,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said structural issues, such as custody and settlement, were keeping institutional money out of Russian stocks but investors already in Russia were not reacting negatively.</p>
<p>&quot;Anybody who invests in this market realises there are going to be little bumps along the way,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Prices of Ministry of Finance bonds, which foreigners may buy, fell in nervous trade on Wednesday but dealers said the fall was due to rumours, denied by the ministry, that some bonds had been frozen.</p>
<p>Dealers said the Min Fin market could also be affected by political concerns.</p>
<p>&quot;Somebody may be affected by it, but the fall may be also due to a correction after (last week's) rise,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>In domestic debt markets, which are driven mainly by supply, an issue of a new tranche of three-month discount Treasury bills yielded an average 63.18 percent at auction, down from 63.76 percent when the bills were first issued a week ago.</p>
