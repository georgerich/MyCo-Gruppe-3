<p>COFFEE: World market for August 22 - Coffee futures in London reversed direction in afternoon trade as a strong arabicas market prompted arbitrage buying interest from fund players. Earlier, selling from origins such as Indonesia knocked robusta prices lower but then buying emerged to take advantage of the higher values in New York, it was added.</p>
<p>At the close the benchmark November contract stood up $16 at $1,695 per tonne, after briefly piercing resistance at $1,700. All other trading positions ended firmer.</p>
<p>Concerns about scarcity of available coffee for September in New York - despite a sharp fall in the contract's open interest - has kept the arabicas market heated recently with attention centered in the September/December spread. Arabica futures in New York continued their upward surge with the September contract once again widening its lead over the deferred positions.</p>
<p>The soluble market defied an earlier call based on weaker prices in London. There were no deliveries notices issued on Thursday, the first day of the notice period, and this prompted the rush of short covering. The daily warehouse data also showed coffee that was pending classification taken off, adding to the tight supply concerns. Thursday's data showed some more bags not passing with now only 13,750 bags pending classification. Sources suggest that less than half the 19,000 bags will pass.</p>
<p>FUNDAMENTALS</p>
<p>BRAZIL - Brazil will auction 20,023 60-kg bags from government coffee stocks on August 28, the Industry and Commerce Ministry announced. According to the ministry's auction, the coffee will once again be Riada, Rio and Riozona type arabica, from crop years spanning the late 1980s. The scale of the auction underlines current policy of selling only small amounts of stocks during the sensitive post-harvest period. Brazil's coffee harvest is now in its final stages.</p>
<p>UGANDA - Good weather and maturing of a new coffee strain that increases yields will boost Uganda's production in the next crop year starting on October 1. Widespread rains during the current crop year should continue into the new season ensuring sustained production in key growing areas. Improved crop husbandry encouraged by farm gate prices rising as the world price recovered from five-year lows in 1989 also helped boost yields.</p>
<p>In the 12 months to the end of July, the country produced a record 3.96 million 60-kg bags of coffee, of which 3.44 million bags were exported. Total exports for the crop year are expected to reach 3.8 million bags, up from 2.76 million exported in 1994/95.</p>
<p>ITALY - Coffee imports in February 1996 amounted to 494,616 bags, up from last year's 467,579 bags. This brought cumulative imports in the first two months of 1996 (January/February) up to 1.01 million bags, 6.4 per cent more than was imported in the like period the previous year.</p>
<p>Total imports in 1995 reached 5.39 million bags against 5.47 million bags in 1994. Major suppliers of green coffee in January/February 1996 were Brazil (248,200 vs 279,900 bags), Zaire (103,100 vs 145,700 bags) and India (82,800 vs 69,200 bags).</p>
<p>Coffee exports in February 1996 amounted to 58,926 bags against 54,807 bags in February 1995. This brought cumulative exports in January/February 1996 up to 121,892 bags, 27.1 per cent more than in the corresponding period the previous year. Total exports in 1995 amounted to 738,894 bags compared to 702,542 bags in 1994. The major markets for Italian roast and ground in 1996 were France (46,100 vs 24,600 bags) and Germany (18,700 vs 16,300 bags).</p>
