<p>Brazilian buyers have recently cancelled between 60,000 and 200,000 tonnes of U.S. hard red winter wheat to buy Argentine wheat, Argentine exporters said Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;I heard this morning that the Brazilians have cancelled 60,000 to 200,000 tonnes and obviously they are replacing it with Argentine wheat,&quot; said one trader. He said that Brazilian buyers have paid $203 a tonne for Argentine September wheat.</p>
<p>He said the driving factor behind the move was the 10-percent import duty that Brazilian buyers have to pay on wheat they import from outside the Mercosur customs union, of which Argentina is a member.</p>
<p>Commenting on rumors in Kansas Friday that Brazilians had cancelled three shipments of U.S. hard red winter in the past 24 hours, another trader said: &quot;I think it's happened, or it's in the works. The market is long on wheat, so the farmers are nervous because in in a month's time they'll get 30 bucks, 40 bucks less for their wheat, so they're pushing to sell now.&quot;</p>
<p>He said: &quot;I think the sales were done last week and the cancellations came this week after all the paperwork.&quot;</p>
<p>The trader added he thought the switch in origin was probably done through the same exporter.</p>
<p>A third trader confirmed the rumors, saying &quot;Brazil has dumped 200,000 tonnes of American wheat so far this year to buy Argentine.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the Brazilians were buying for September and October and the sales were likely to continue as another 200,000 tonnes of old crop Argentine wheat remained to be sold for export.</p>
