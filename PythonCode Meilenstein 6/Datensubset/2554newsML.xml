<p>German utility group Viag AG said Tuesday its group pretax profit fell 21 percent to 1.18 billion marks ($791 million) in the first half.</p>
<p>The group said in a statement that its operating profit had &quot;clearly improved&quot; in the first half of 1996 and a sharp drop in its pre-tax profit was due purely to special income factors.</p>
<p>In 1995, around 40 percent of Viag's first-half profit was the result of one-time gains from the sale of its 43.4 percent stake in Germany's biggest paper maker PWA and other major changes in shareholdings.</p>
<p>Viag said its group sales rose to 21.8 billion marks ($14.6 billion) from 21.4 billion ($14.4 billion) in the first half of 1996 and that its operating profit rose 10 percent in the period.</p>
<p>Sales in its chemicals, energy and logistics divisions advanced in the period while packaging sales dropped.</p>
<p>In the first half of 1995, Viag and its units bought several major companies including SBI Systems Bio-Industries, bought by Viag's chemicals division and a majority stake in Computer 2000.</p>
