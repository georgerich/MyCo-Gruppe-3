<p>-- BUNDESBANK CUTS REPO RATE TO 3 PER CENT</p>
<p>The Bundesbank has announced a larger than had been expected cut in the country's securities repurchase (repo) rate. The move down to 3 per cent, aimed at boosting the German economy and taking pressure of the French franc, was justified primarily on the grounds of slower growth in the country's money supply figures. The cut was followed by a similar move by the Bank of France. The German decision had been expected, though the scale of the cut was greeted with some surprise.</p>
<p>-- BASS SET FOR CARLSBERG-TETLEY DEAL</p>
<p>Brewer Bass has announced that it is close to reaching an agreement that will see it pay 200 million stg for the stake in Carlsberg-Tetley owned by Allied Domecq  ALL.D. Bass, however, is insisting on provisions that will allow it to withdraw should it transpire that the government calls for pubs in the group to be disposed of in return for agreement to the merger. Bass, the UK's largest brewer, is reported to have identified a number of synergies that can be capitalised upon between itself and Carlsberg-Tetley.</p>
<p>--  BSKYB TO OFFER INTERNET ACCESS THROUGH TV SETS</p>
<p>UK satellite broadcaster BSkyB is planning to offer as part of its planned digital TV services high-speed access to the Internet. The company revealed that the set-top boxes it will be using for receipt of digital signals will have the power of an average PC and will be equipped with a high-speed modem. It is hoped that this strategy will transform the TV set into one of the main routes through which people access electronic data.</p>
<p>-- BET HELPS RENTOKIL ADVANCE 36 PER CENT</p>
<p>The world's leading business services group, Rentokil, has announced an increase of 35.6 per cent in profits for the first half. The figure of 134.5 million stg was boosted by contributions from BET, which Rentokil acquired earlier in the year in a 2.1 billion stg deal. BET chairman Sir Clive Thompson noted that integration of the two companies is proceeding as planned and should result in annual cost savings of 20 million stg.</p>
<p>-- TUBE DISPUTE SETTLED AS OTHER RAIL STRIKES BEGIN</p>
<p>A last-minute deal with the RMT union means that a stoppage on London's underground railway system scheduled for Friday will not now go ahead. The agreement with the union will involve staff moving towards a 35-hour week in return for lower than the rate of inflation increases in pay for two years. A similar deal had already been accepted by the other main union involved, ASLEF. However, rail users in other parts of the country will still face disruption as catering staff and conductors on a number of regional railway companies strike.</p>
<p>-- CBI FORECASTS NO INTEREST RATE RISE BEFORE ELECTION</p>
<p>The latest report from the Confederation of British Industry on the prognosis for the British economy foresees no need for another rise in interest rates prior to the next general election. The employers federation notes that strong economic growth and low inflation can be expected, but that the Chancellor may have to exercise caution with regard to tax cuts in the next Budget. The forecast came as other figures indicated that companies have been reducing their inventory levels rather than meeting demand through increased production.</p>
<p>-- GERMANY MAINTAINS DOUBTS OVER BSE IN LAMB</p>
<p>The German government, in the wake of a warning delivered by a minister over doubts about the safety of British lamb, has been defending itself against accusations of whipping up hysteria. It has stressed that safety of such meat will remain an issue while uncertainty remains surrounding the possible transmission of BSE from cattle to sheep. The National Farmers' Union in Britain has expressed astonishment at the statement, describing it as unjustified.</p>
<p>-- BRITISH GAS MAY RESIST COMPETITION MOVES</p>
<p>British Gas has announced that there are certain aspects of planned reforms of competition for its infrastructure division, Transco, which it believes will actually hold back preparations for the advent of an opening of the domestic gas market in 1998. The company has, however, stated that it sees no problems with competition proposals for other areas of operation, including metering and gas storage. Executives from British Gas are still assessing details of the proposed price controls on Transco.</p>
<p>-- SEVEN ON BAIL IN CABLE TV INQUIRY</p>
<p>A number of people have been bailed after being arrested by the Serious Fraud Office as part of an investigation into possible fraud in construction contracts for the UK's cable industry. The seven arrested included two former employees of the country's largest cable company, Bell Cablemedia, as well as a number of building contractors. Bell Cablemedia is not itself under investigation, however. While the amount of money involved has not been revealed it has been noted that the SFO usually only deals with crimes involving in excess of one million sterling.</p>
<p>-- MINIMUM WAGE SHOULD BE 'NO MORE THAN 3.50 STG'</p>
<p>According to John Philpott of the Employment Institute the minimum wage proposed by the Labour party should not exceed three pounds fifty. In a report published by the Institute of Personnel and Development it is suggested that the wage for those aged less than 25 should be lower still. The report warns that certain industries that have traditionally made heavy use of low-wage staff will encounter difficulties in adjusting to the creation of a legally enforceable minimum wage.</p>
