<p>At Home Corp., which is developing technology and a service that would make static Web pages jazzier and appear more quickly by piping them through cable TV networks, Wednesday announced partnerships with more than 60 television, print media and Web media companies.</p>
<p>Among those working with At Home are The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, USA Today, The Weather Channel and the Discovery Channel cable channels, The Motley Fool online investment forum and HotWired, the Internet publication owned by Wired magazine's publisher.</p>
<p>These and other publishers have agreed to participate in At Home's Media Development Programme, in which At Home is providing access to software tools so these media companies can develop versions of their content to run on At Home.</p>
<p>&quot;We are working with the development community to create engaging and compelling content and applications that leverage the broadband medium,&quot; said Charles Moldow, vice president of At Home, at a press conference here. Broadband refers to a wider &quot;pipe&quot; for transmitting data and video.</p>
<p>The At Home network would enable computer users to access the Internet using high-speed cable modems, which are connected to cable TV lines instead of the slower, more common modems that use telephone lines.</p>
<p>The more widespread modems can efficiently transmit text and relatively simple graphics, but they are ill-suited to more data-intensive voice, video and graphics that can make a Web page look more like television or a movie and less like a printed page.</p>
<p>However, At Home -- which has been closely watched since its formation last year -- has experienced substantial engineering difficulties in attempting to overlay its Internet network on top of existing cable networks, delaying the introduction of the service.</p>
<p>But executives said that, given the scope of the project they are undertaking, some delays were inevitable.</p>
<p>&quot;Today, we are feeling very bullish about our readiness to deploy the service. This is a complex undertaking,&quot; said Dean Gilbert, senior vice president of sales and marketing. &quot;It's not just a fatter pipe... It's a fully integrated offering.&quot;</p>
<p>The privately-held Mountain View, Calif.-based company says it still plans to introduce its service in selected markets in the fall and later this year through its three cable TV partners, Tele-Communications Inc., Comcast Corp. and Cox Communications Inc.</p>
<p>At Home executives said they will announce more network partners in September and that they are in discussions with everyone in the cable industry. The cable companies will set the pricing, but they estimate some are planning on charging around $30 to $40 a month, with possible discounts for initial startup.</p>
<p>The executives, including founding Chief Executie Will Hearst, now a partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers, declined to make any forecasts on how many customers they expect to attract.</p>
<p>&quot;As PC penetration grows, hopefully, in a decade we will have a service that will be in the majority of homes,&quot; Gilbert said.</p>
