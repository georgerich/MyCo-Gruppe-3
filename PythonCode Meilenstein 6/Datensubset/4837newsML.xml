<title>ISRAEL: Arafat asks Egypt to help halt Jewish settlement.</title>

<p>Palestinian President Yasser Arafat has asked Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to mediate with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to halt Jewish settlements in the Palestinian occupied West Bank and Gaza.</p>
<p>&quot;An explosion between the Palestinian landowners and the settlers has come very close as a result of the Israeli government policy supporting settlement,&quot; Arafat told Mubarak in a message this week, Palestinian officials said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sure that your excellency will not spare any effort to get the peace process back to its correct track,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Netanyahu's government this month cancelled a new settlement building freeze imposed by the previous government which made peace deals with the Palestinians.</p>
<p>Palestinians, who hope to eventually establish an independent state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, regard the 130,000 Jews settled amidst the nearly two million Palestinians in the areas since Israel captured them in 1967 as an obstacle.</p>
<p>Under an interim peace deal, Israel handed parts of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip to Palestinian rule in 1994 and 1995. Final peace talks begun before Israel's May elections have yet to resume under Netanyahu.</p>
<p>Egypt, which was the first Arab state to make peace with Israel in 1979, has acted as a mediator in the Middle East peace process that started in Madrid in 1991.</p>
