<title>UK: UK money market rates tighten on large shortage.</title>
<headline>UK money market rates tighten on large shortage.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-08-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>UK overnight money market rates briefly tightened on a larger than expected liquidity shortage but later settled back as the shortage was almost completely covered.</p>
<p>After touching 6.0 percent on the Bank of England's announcement of a 1.8 billion stg shortage, rates were trading at around 5-3/4 5/8 towards the close.</p>
<p>The shortage was later revised up to 1.9 billion stg and assistance totalled 1.87 billion.</p>
<p>&quot;People had expected an easy day but the shortage was larger than expected,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Philip Shaw of Union Discount predicted further tightness next week, with this week's gilt repo leading to a drain of 835 million stg from the market.</p>
<p>&quot;Moreover, a gilt auction is scheduled for next week and these have recently been associated with periods of expensive overnight rates,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Hence the short end of the curve may remain tight next week, even though the auction is 2.5 billion stg instead of 3.0 billion.&quot;</p>
<p>In the gilt repo market, general collateral (GC) rates largely tracked unsecured rates. Overnight GC was last traded at around 5.50 45.</p>
<p>Traders said no stock was trading at exceptionally special levels, with the 7.0 percent gilts due 2001 back at around 5.0 percent from levels over 200 basis points below GC earlier in the week.</p>
