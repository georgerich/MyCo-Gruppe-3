<title>INDIA: India's Rao wins respite in cheating case.</title>
<headline>India's Rao wins respite in cheating case.</headline>
<dateline>NEW DELHI 1996-08-22</dateline>

<p>Former Indian prime minister P.V. Narasimha Rao won a partial reprieve in a cheating case on Thursday when the Supreme Court ordered a magistrate to consider the leader's appeal against a summons to appear in court.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court ordered the appointment of a new lower court magistrate to take up Rao's claim that another judge overstepped his authority last month when he summoned the former prime minister to appear as a co-accused in the case.</p>
<p>The court's move offered respite to Rao, whose authority at the head of the Congress party has been undermined by the cheating case summons, by allowing the former prime minister to ask a new magistrate to rescind the summons.</p>
<p>But the Supreme Court stood by its refusal, announced on Wednesday, to quash a July 9 order by Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Prem Kumar summoning Rao to appear in the case. The July 9 order was later upheld by the Delhi High Court.</p>
<p>&quot;It is appropriate not to hear the petition in this court,&quot; the Supreme court bench said, referring to Rao's appeal which would now be heard by a lower court.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court said Rao would not have to appear in person before any tribunal in connection with the case until his complaint was considered by the new magistrate. At each stage of the appeal process Rao has been represented by his lawyer.</p>
<p>&quot;We are of the view that it would subserve the ends of justice if the matter is heard by some other judicial officer,&quot; the two-judge bench said in its order.</p>
<p>&quot;Therefore we request the Delhi High Court to appoint a new magistrate to deal with this matter,&quot; the court said.</p>
<p>Rao's lawyer indicated that he would ask the new magistrate, yet to be assigned to the case, to consider the former prime minister's request to have the summons rescinded. But the magistrate could also uphold the summons and force Rao to appear.</p>
<p>At issue was a case filed by expatriate Indian businessman Lakhubhai Pathak, who alleged Rao and a Hindu guru conspired to cheat him of $100,000 in 1983.</p>
<p>Pathak says he paid the money to guru Chandraswami in a failed attempt to secure a state newsprint contract after Rao, then foreign minister, assured him at a meeting in a New York hotel that his &quot;work would be done&quot;.</p>
<p>Rao says he is innocent of the charge of criminal conspiracy to cheat, and has denied he was in New York on the dates mentioned by Pathak.</p>
<p>Analysts say Rao would probably be forced to relinquish leadership of Congress if he were forced to testify.</p>
<p>Congress has governed India for all but four years since independence in 1947. But the party was soundly defeated in recent general elections, forcing Rao to step down.</p>
<p>Rao's lawyers have argued that their client cannot be named as a co-accused if he was not mentioned in Pathak's initial complaint, filed with police in 1987.</p>
