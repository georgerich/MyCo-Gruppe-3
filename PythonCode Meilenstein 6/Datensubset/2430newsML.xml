<p>China should take advantage of easing inflation and switch its fund raising efforts to longer term bonds, an official newspaper said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Financial News, published by the central bank, said that the reduced interest rates meant that Beijing could lock in long-term funds at cheaper rates.</p>
<p>&quot;Now that we are in a period of lower inflation, this is the time to shift to longer term maturities for government funds,&quot; the newspaper said.</p>
<p>China's retail price inflation rate slipped to 6.9 percent for the first seven months of the year, well below a target of 10 percent for the year and down sharply from the 14.8 percent for all of 1995.</p>
<p>That persuaded the central bank to cut bank interest rates once this year, and many analysts expect another rate reduction by the end of the year.</p>
<p>China also felt confident enough to eliminate a hefty subsidy on new bank deposits and government debt of more than three years as of April.</p>
<p>The subsidy, paid on top of the normal interest rate, was aimed at attracting investors during a period of high inflation.</p>
<p>The subsidy hit a peak of 13.24 percent in December of last year, paid in addition to interest of 12.24 for three-year bank deposits.</p>
<p>In 1995, China issued 151 billion yuan ($18.18 billion) in domestic treasury debt, representing 2.6 pct of its gross domestic product, according to the daily.</p>
<p>&quot;The government had to raise interest rates on bonds and to give a subsidy on top of this. As a result, this increased the the cost of raising funds and the burden of repayment,&quot; the newspaper said.</p>
<p>In July, Beijing issued its first tranche of 10-year bonds. They paid annual interest of 11.83 percent but with no subsidy, making them a far cheaper way for the central government to raise funds.</p>
<p>&quot;The advantage to the state is that it is simpler to manage,&quot; said Xu Hongyuan, an economist at the State Information Centre.</p>
<p>&quot;From the investor's standpoint, the bonds are also quite attractive,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>The newspaper said in addition that China also had too much of its debt concentrated in three to five-year maturities, bunching up repayments and straining government finances unnecessarily.</p>
<p>&quot;If we can rely on a certain amount of 10-year treasury bonds that will ease the problems,&quot; the newspaper said.</p>
