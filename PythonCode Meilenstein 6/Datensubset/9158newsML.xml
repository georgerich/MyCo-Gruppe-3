<p>Russian security supremo Alexander Lebed and Chechen rebel chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov, who signed a document to end weeks of fighting in the regional capital Grozny earlier on Thursday, have agreed a ceasefire from midday (0800 GMT) on Friday, Interfax news agency said.</p>
<p>&quot;According to the document, all military actions will stop on Chechen territory from midday on August 23. All special operations or terrorist acts are banned,&quot; the agency said. Russia usually refers to its attacks on villages in the mostly-Moslem region to oust rebels as &quot;special operations&quot;.  </p>
<p>Lebed said after signing the deal earlier on Thursday that Russian troops would leave the regional capital Grozny, much of which has been seized by rebels for more than two weeks, and subsequently start leaving Chechnya.</p>
<p>Lebed also said that under the deal Grozny will be run by joint military administrations comprising troops and rebels.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands died in Chechnya after Russia sent troops to quell the region's independence bid. Rebels want full independence from Moscow while the Kremlin insists that Chechnya should remain part of Russia.</p>
<p>Lebed said he would come back to Chechnya in two days to sign another agreement which would sort out political roots of the conflict including the issue of the region's future status. He gave no details of a possible deal.</p>
