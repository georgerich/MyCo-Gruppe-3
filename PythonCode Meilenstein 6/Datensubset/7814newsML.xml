<p>Banco Portugues de Investimento fulfilled a long-held ambition on Thursday when it won the struggle for Banco de Fomento &amp; Exterior, the state-sector bank that is being privatised, in a move that will create the country's fourth largest banking group.</p>
<p>The Finance Ministry announced that Banco Portugues was the only candidate left after a special jury had eliminated its only two rivals for the 65 percent of BFE on offer.</p>
<p>&quot;The recommendation of the jury was that the only proposal to pass to the final phase was that of BPI,&quot; Sousa Franco told a news conference.</p>
<p>The ministry said that the cabinet had unanimously accepted the recommendation of the jury which felt that BPI was best-placed to support the increase in debt that buying out BFE would involve.</p>
<p>Although no price has yet emerged, BPI must have offered at least 1,980 escudos ($12.94) per share for the 52 million shares in BFE being sold. BFE stock was suspended on Thursday ahead of the announcement at 2,545 escudos ($16.63), which would value the stake at 130 billion escudos ($850 million).</p>
