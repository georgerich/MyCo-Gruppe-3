<p>President Fidel Ramos on Wednesday tried to dispel Christian fears that Moslem rebels would take advantage of a peace deal to impose Islam on the southern Philippines.</p>
<p>&quot;Whoever is thinking this way might as well forget it,&quot; Ramos said. &quot;There will be no Islamisation.&quot;</p>
<p>Ramos has struck a peace deal with the insurgent Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) which involves setting up a Moslem-led council to supervise development of 14 southern provinces.</p>
<p>A provision in the draft accord providing for an Islamic advisory body to help MNLF chief Nur Misuari run the council has raised fears among Christians that the rebels would propagate Islam as a dominant religion in the area.</p>
<p>The country's five million Moslems regard Mindanao as their ancestral homeland although they have become a minority in the area after decades of Christian migration.</p>
<p>Ramos told his weekly news conference Christians should not fear the council because government and MNLF negotiators working out the final text of the peace agreement had dropped any reference to the religious advisory body.</p>
<p>He said Misuari himself had publicly stated the guerrillas would not impose Islam on anyone and that &quot;if some have embraced Islam, it is on a voluntary basis&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;And so we are saying it, there will be no Islamisation and the MNLF are also saying there will be no Islamisation,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Ramos said he did not foresee any delay in the signing in Jakarta shortly of a treaty ending a 24-year MNLF-led rebellion. Indonesia heads an Islamic panel mediating the peace talks.</p>
<p>Philippine officials earlier said they expected the accord to be initialled in Jakarta towards the end of this month to be followed by a ceremonial signing in Manila.</p>
<p>Ramos and Misuari sealed the deal on Monday in an unprecedented meeting in Malabang town, where they also attended a rally to campaign for support for the council.</p>
<p>Christian protests against the accord continued on Wednesday as public transport drivers in southern Iligan city went on strike and 5,000 residents carried cardboard coffins.</p>
<p>Protesters set up human barricades at intersections as the planned three-day strike paralysed about 70 percent of commercial activity in the overwhelmingly Christian city of 280,000 people.</p>
<p>Carrying signs &quot;War is coming&quot;, the protesters burned Ramos' effigy after marching through the city.</p>
<p>&quot;President Ramos, you are Judas, don't sell us,&quot; other signs read.</p>
