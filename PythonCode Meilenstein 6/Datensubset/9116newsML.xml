<p>President Boris Yeltsin said he was not &quot;fully happy&quot; with the performance of his security supremo Alexander Lebed, whom he has ordered to restore peace in rebel Chechnya, RIA news agency said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;One should remember that he (Lebed) constantly promised to solve the Chechnya problem if he had power. Now he has power. Unfortunately no results can yet be seen as far as Chechnya is concerned,&quot; it quoted Yeltsin as saying in an interview with the agency.</p>
<p>Yeltsin's press office said that the Kremlin leader gave the interview on Thursday. A press officer could not say whether it was a live interview or written answers to questions.</p>
<p>Yeltsin said he hoped Lebed, who held talks with the separatist rebels on Wednesday and Thursday, would &quot;encourage them to start peace negotiations&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;At the same time Boris Nikolayevich (Yeltsin) said he was 'not fully happy' with his representative's work in Chechnya,&quot; RIA quoted Yeltsin as saying with reference to Lebed.</p>
<p>Lebed, who arrived in Chechnya on Wednesday, has cancelled an ultimatum by Russian commanders to launch an all-out bombardment of the regional capital.</p>
<p>He was said on Thursday to be making good progress in talks with separatist fighters on a permanent ceasefire.</p>
<p>The latest upsurge of fighting in the 20-month conflict that had killed tens of thousands people took place after the rebels seized most of Grozny on August 6.</p>
<p>Yeltsin has ordered Lebed to restore Russian control over Grozny before the end of the month. Lebed argued later that a major military operation in the city would lead to bloodshed and a burst of resentment at home and abroad.</p>
<p>Yeltsin told RIA that he receives daily all information about the conflict. &quot;We should not despair,&quot; RIA quoted him as saying.</p>
