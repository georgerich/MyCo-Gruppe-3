<p>Syria accused Israel on Wednesday of launching a hysterical campaign against it and said its arms purchase were only for defensive purposes.</p>
<p>The ruling party newspaper al-Baath also said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was escalating tension against Syria to force it to drop its demand for a full Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights, captured in the 1967 Middle East war.</p>
<p>&quot;Suddenly a hysterical campaign is launched against Syria and its defence capabilities with the participation of Netanyahu, his generals and his media networks,&quot; al-Baath said.</p>
<p>Israeli channel two television on Monday said Syria had tested weeks ago a long-range scud missile able to hit targets in Israeli cities with the aim of &quot;verifying the Syrian army's ability to perform an operational launch.&quot;</p>
<p>Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy told Syria on Tuesday that missile tests were no way to signal a desire for peace.</p>
<p>&quot;If Syria wants peace, the tone and style is not with missiles or weapons like that,&quot; Levy told reporters.</p>
<p>Tension between Syria and Israel mounted after the Likud leader, elected in May, vowed not to relinquish the Golan.</p>
<p>Al-Baath said the sudden Israeli accusations against Syria's defence capabilities were only an attempt to undermine Damascus' role in the peace process and its strategic option to exchange land for peace.</p>
<p>&quot;Netanyahu, who shut the door to peace efforts and led the peace process to a dead end because of his extremist and arrogant policies, could not find a way out but to resort to the policy of force and threats and therefore is using any pretext to escalate tension in the region to the maximum.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;These crazy Israeli campaigns cannot affect the Syrian position...and are rejected as a whole,&quot; al-Baath said.</p>
<p>The official daily Tishreen hit back by saying Israel should have its nuclear installations inspected because they were a threat to regional security before judging other countries.</p>
<p>&quot;The failure of taking serious and effective measures against Israel's nuclear armament will encourage large scale armament in the Middle East because Israel cannot grant itself this advantage and raise hell if an Arab country dares buy defensive weapons,&quot; Tishreen said.</p>
