<p>A survey that found slow progress in the U.S. corn (maize) crop supported world benchmark grain prices in the Chicago futures pits on Wednesday. Elsewhere, August holidays continued to subdue activity in the commodity markets. Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) soybean and corn futures were both higher early on reports from a U.S. crop tour indicating progress lagging far behind normal in the eastern U.S. corn belt, traders said.</p>
<p>Crop scouts on the ProFarmer tour in Ohio and Indiana said potential corn yields were below last year's tour estimate. They also said the soybean pod count was below the level of a year ago.</p>
<p>Wheat was slightly lower on a technical break but was underpinned by the gains in corn and soybeans plus unsettled weather in U.S. and Canadian spring wheat areas.</p>
<p>Corn was soon 1-3/4 to three cents per bushel higher, with September up three at $3.65-1/4. Wheat was unchanged to 1/2 cent per bushel lower, with September unchanged at $4.54-1/2.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Wednesday's markets, silver consolidated at firmer levels after fixing at its highest since June 19, 1996 on Tuesday on buying by speculators.</p>
<p>It fixed at $5.2075 an ounce after $5.2025 on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Gold closed in London at $387.25 after $387.55 on Tuesday in quiet activity.</p>
<p>Industrial metals were little changed after copper found buying support on an early dip.</p>
<p>Coffee remained firm on fund and speculative interest based on lingering concerns about nearby tight supply after news earlier this week of a drop of 6,259 60-kg bags in the U.S. certified coffee stockpile to 34,516 bags.</p>
<p>The London November Robusta contract was up $27 at $1,702 per tonne at the close .</p>
