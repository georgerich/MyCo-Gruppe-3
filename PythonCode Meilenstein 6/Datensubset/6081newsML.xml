<p>Coffee growers followed the lead of coca growers in Colombia's impoverished south by staging a mass protest march this week to demand more government aid for what some describe as a dying industry.</p>
<p>The march Wednesday by thousands of disgruntled growers in the central coffee-growing province of Quindio came despite an announcement hours earlier that Colombia's internal coffee price had been raised to 235,500 pesos per 125-kilogram load.</p>
<p>The price, set by the National Coffee Growers Committee, had held at 201,500 pesos per 125-kg since February 16.  </p>
<p>At Colombia's official &quot;representative&quot; exchange rate, the new price for growers now stands at about $0.80 cents a pound. That compares to prices as high as $1.40 a pound that Colombian excelso beans have fetched in New York this week.</p>
<p>The Growers Committee -- which Finance Minister Jose Antonio Ocampo sits on along with officials of the central National Coffee Growers Federation -- actually set the new price at 221,500 pesos. But it included a 14,000 peso premium because of the poor outlook for this year's harvest, set to begin in September.  </p>
<p>&quot;Growers should feel satisfied with this new agreement,&quot; Ocampo told reporters in announcing the price hike. He added that it would provide &quot;a satisfactory income&quot; for growers.</p>
<p>Spokesmen for the estimated 10,000 growers who marched on the provincial capital of Quindio said the price hike was welcome. But they also said it was barely enough to cover soaring production costs.</p>
<p>&quot;It's important that there be complementary measures to deal with high interest rates, the high cost of equipment and the fight against the berry borer,&quot; Augusto Arias, a Quindio producer, said by phone from provincial capital Armenia.  </p>
<p>&quot;Nobody can work with such high financial costs,&quot; he added, referring to bank lending rates currently set at more than 40 percent and growing costs associated with fighting the berry borer -- a plague that threatens to ravish trees across the country.</p>
<p>Members of the National Coffee Growers Committee have talked in recent months about measures aimed at easing the plight of cash-strapped growers, including the need to lower interest rates. But the Committee faces its own financial problems, including the risk of losing market share because of the Colombian peso's recent rise against the dollar.  </p>
<p>A stronger local currency makes Colombian exports more expensive abroad.</p>
<p>&quot;We've done everything possible to give growers a better income,&quot; Diego Arango, the Committee's president, told reporters. &quot;We've made a great effort, but to go any further would have meant jumping into the void.&quot;</p>
<p>Wednesday's march, in which growers demanded more government aid, was reminiscent of the marches staged by tens of thousands of peasants across southern Colombia since mid-July to protest against the government coca leaf eradication program.  </p>
<p>The peasants, in three jungle-covered provinces, say coca is the one staple crop they can survive on. There were unconfirmed reports this week that opium poppy growers in the central coffee- growing province of Tolima were planning on joining in the protests against drug crop eradication.</p>
