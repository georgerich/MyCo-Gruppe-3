<title>COLOMBIA: Colombian troops in new clash with coca growers.</title>
<headline>Colombian troops in new clash with coca growers.</headline>
<dateline>BOGOTA, Colombia 1996-08-22</dateline>

<p>At least one demonstrator was killed and more than eight were injured on Thursday when thousands of coca farmers trying to enter the capital of Colombia's southern Caqueta province clashed with troops, officials said.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the governor's office in Caqueta said the demonstrators sought to force their way across a bridge on the outskirts of Florencia, the provincial capital but were turned back by troops firing tear gas and automatic weapons.</p>
<p>He said said four soliders suffered machete wounds in the clash.</p>
<p>Nine demonstrators with bullet wounds were admitted to the Maria Inmaculada Hospital in Florencia, a hospital spokeswoman said adding that one of them, a man aged about 25, died of his injuries.</p>
<p>She said more injured demonstrators were admitted to two other hospitals in the area but could give no figures.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of peasants in Caqueta and neighbouring provinces have staged protest marches since mid-July against the government's chemical spraying of illicit drug crops.</p>
<p>At least seven peasants have been killed in violence stemming from the protests so far.</p>
<p>Farmers across much of Colombia's impoverished southern provinces argue that coca is the only staple crop that allows them to make a living wage. But the government, under heavy pressure from Washington to wipe out tens of thousands of acres (hectares) of coca leaf and opium poppy fields this year, says it will continue spraying them from the air with herbicide.</p>
