<p>Mother Teresa's health has deteriorated and the ailing Nobel Peace Prize winner now has malaria, one of the doctors treating her said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Her cardiac status is unstable and is closely monitored by a team of doctors,&quot; said Dr A.K. Bardhan, one of a team of physicians caring for the 85-year-old Roman Catholic missionary.</p>
<p>Bhardhan said a parasite, P. vivax, which causes malaria, had been found in her blood. Mother Teresa suffered with malaria in 1993.  </p>
<p>An official at Woodlands Nursing Home, a hospital in the eastern Indian city of Calcutta where Mother Teresa has been under treatment since Tuesday, said &quot;her condition has deteriorated since the morning&quot;.</p>
<p>Bardhan said Mother Teresa was conscious but continued to have a fever and was on a respirator in the intensive care unit.</p>
<p>Mother Teresa, regarded by many as a living saint for her devotion to the world's destitute, was admitted to Woodlands on Tuesday with a temperature of 103 degrees Fahrenheit (39.4 degrees Celsius) and severe vomiting.  </p>
<p>She developed heart problems on Wednesday, but had responded to treatment and was in stable condition until Friday morning.</p>
<p>A five-member team of specialists was formed on Thursday to monitor Mother Teresa's condition.</p>
<p>Arguably the best known Roman Catholic missionary and one of the world's most widely recognised figures, Mother Teresa, who is of Albanian descent, turns 86 on Tuesday.</p>
<p>In 1949 she founded a network of missions for the poor and the sick in Calcutta, India's most densely populated city.  </p>
<p>Now, the Missionaries of Charity order has nearly 3,000 people ministering to the needy, dying and orphaned in the slums of 200 cities.</p>
<p>Her health began to deteriorate in 1989 when she was fitted with the pacemaker. In 1991, she was treated at a California hospital for heart disease and bacterial pneumonia.</p>
<p>In Rome in May 1993, she fell, breaking three ribs. In August the same year, while in New Delhi to receive an award, she developed malaria, complicated by her heart and lung problems. The mosquito-borne disease thrives in hot, humid climates.</p>
