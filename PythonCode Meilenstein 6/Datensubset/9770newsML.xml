<headline>France's Juppe says court upholds him on Africans.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1996-08-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>Prime Minister Alain Juppe said on Thursday that France's highest administrative court had upheld his view that 300 African immigrants holed up in a Paris church did not have the right to stay in France.</p>
<p>But Juppe, in a statement given to LCI television, said the Council of State had not ruled out a new review of individual cases.  </p>
<p>&quot;The Council of State has concluded that a right to a residence permit does not exist. This is common sense,&quot; Juppe said in the videotaped statement.</p>
<p>&quot;But the government can always, after a case-by-case review of individual situations, use its authority to grant residency in exceptional circumstances,&quot; he said. &quot;This precisely confirms the government's policy as announced several weeks ago.&quot;</p>
<p>Juppe had asked the council to give an opinion on the situation of the 300 Africans, including 10 hunger strikers in the 49th day of a fast, who have been occupying the Saint-Bernard church in an effort to pressure the government to let them remain in France.</p>
<p>The protesters, who said earlier that the fast would continue until all 300 were given residence permits, said they would call a meeting to discuss Juppe's stance.</p>
