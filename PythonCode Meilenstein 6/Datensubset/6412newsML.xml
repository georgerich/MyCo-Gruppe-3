<p>CSCE nearby cocoa futures ended firmer Wednesday, buoyed by speculative buying, floor sources said.</p>
<p>But persistant trade and manufacturer selling stemmed gains, and kept the December contract from breaching key resistance at $1,445 a tonne.</p>
<p>&quot;Generally, the market wants to levitate higher but every day there has been some selling at the close,&quot; one trader said. &quot;It's like there is a battle going on.&quot;</p>
<p>Benchmark December cocoa settled up $5 a tonne, to $1,435, after ranging between $1,444 and $1,425. Spot September rose $7, to $1,386, while the back months closed $7 firmer to $1 weaker. Volume reached an estimated 6,219 lots.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, traders said preliminary West African crop forecasts, estimating a smaller and later 1996/97 harvest compared to last season's record yield, continued to underpin the market.</p>
<p>However, they said the market was likely to linger between $1,400 and $1,500 until the next round of estimates emerged in late August.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is in a holding pattern until people can get a good grasp on what the West African crop will be,&quot; another trader said. --Patricia Avidan, New York Commodities Desk +1 212 859 1640</p>
