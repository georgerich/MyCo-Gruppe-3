<p>Darwin's theory of evolution will apply to online newspapers, and to guarantee survival major players must establish themselves within five years or risk extinction, according to a report by a research firm.</p>
<p>&quot;Just as in the evolution of a natural species, development of the online newspaper industry will prove painful, perhaps fatal to those who cannot adapt,&quot; said the report by the Boston-based Yankee Group.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe that major players must firmly establish themselves online within five years or risk long-term decline.&quot;</p>
<p>The study's author, Gregory Wester, said in a telephone interview Friday that the &quot;shakeout for online services is looming.&quot;</p>
<p>Average start-up costs were $500,000, and the newspapers generally hired seven to 12 workers to maintain an online service, the study found. Two major online players have taken different approaches, both with good results.</p>
<p>The Times Mirror Co.'s Los Angeles Times has brought its brand-name to the Web with latimes.com and has teamed up with the Pacific Bell phone company, which distributes a browser to automatically link users to the newspaper's Web site. The Pacific Bell link produces revenue for the newspaper.</p>
<p>The Times recently bought the hollywood.com Web site and is already teamed up with The Associated Press, Quote.Com for stock quotes, careerpath.com for online classifieds and similar services for real estate listings, The Yankee Group reported.</p>
<p>The Times' previous relationship with the Prodigy online service brought in about $1.3 million in annual revenue.</p>
<p>The Boston Globe, owned by The New York Times Co. has taken a slightly different path to the Web, choosing to combine its identity with a number of regional partners such as local radio and television stations, trade and city magazines and nonprofit groups. The Web site is supported by advertising, and fees will be charged for access to archived information, the report said.</p>
<p>The Tribune Co.'s, Chicago Tribune, which has a longstanding relationship with the America Online online service, told The Yankee Group that its Chicago Online, launched in 1992, was profitable by 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;So far, the Chicago Tribune has not been as imaginative or far-reaching as the Los Angeles Times and Boston Globe in creating partnerships for Web site content,&quot; the report said. &quot;It does, however, have investment relationships with companies that help enable electronic commerce and the Chicago Tribune may be poised to roll out electronic commerce capabilities,&quot; or selling goods and services over the Internet.</p>
<p>The Tampa Tribune, published by Media General Inc., has set up four separate -- but linked -- Web sites.</p>
<p>&quot;By putting up four very different sites, we will teach people to see the diversity of information we provide and get them away from thinking that all we are is the traditional&quot; newspaper, Rich Scheuerman of the Tribune said in the report. &quot;We are trying to get people to see us in a whole new way.&quot;</p>
<p>The Yankee Group did not say which model would prevail in the competition for cyber-readers.</p>
<p>The report did single out for criticism The Dallas Morning News, calling the content of its Web site &quot;shallow and static&quot; and said the A.H. Belo Corp.-owned paper had been &quot;fiscally conservative&quot; in setting it up.</p>
<p>National newspapers have already lost out to other Web-based news, the Yankee Group said without giving an example. It added that the battle for the local market is still to be decided.</p>
<p>&quot;Newspapers must part with print-replica thinking if they are to take advantage of the technology to meet people's needs for information,&quot; the report said.</p>
