<p>President Bill Clinton sent a letter to Russian President Boris Yeltsin on Wednesday urging an end to the violence in Chechnya.</p>
<p>&quot;This cycle of violence must come to an end because prolonged fighting is only going to endanger civilians,&quot; White House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters.  </p>
<p>Russian forces have been pounding the rebel-held Chechnyan city of Grozny in an effort to crush the guerrilla resistance in the breakaway region.</p>
<p>McCurry said Clinton's letter to Yeltsin was sent overnight and there had not been a response. He said the United States was encouraged that Russian security chief Alexander Lebed was in Chechnya trying to lift the threat of bombardment of Grozny.</p>
<p>&quot;The humanitarian situation there is very difficult and we continue to call upon all the parties to minimize the conflict, to return to the kinds of discussions that could bring the conflict to an end,&quot; McCurry told reporters.</p>
<p>Asked about Yeltsin's health in the wake of rumors that the Russian leader is seriously ill, McCurry said Washington had no indication that Yeltsin was doing anything but taking a long vacation after his strenuous re-election campaign.</p>
