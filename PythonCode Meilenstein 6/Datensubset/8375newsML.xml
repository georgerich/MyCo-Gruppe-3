<p>Denmark on Thursday upgraded key economic forecasts and restated its goal of a balanced budget, saying that recent data indicated that the economy was recovering from a growth slowdown faster than foreseen.</p>
<p>The economy ministry said that it now expected 1996 inflation and unemployment to be lower than previously predicted and the current account surplus to be larger.</p>
<p>It raised its forecast for the 1996 public sector deficit but cut its 1997 projection, and economy minister Marianne Jelved said she still hoped to eliminate the shortfall.</p>
<p>&quot;The government intends to see public expenditure balance in 1997. It is a necessary requirement to allow Denmark to begin paying off its large public debt,&quot; Jelved said in an update of forecasts last issued in May.</p>
<p>Her ministry, basing its calculations on current economic conditions, said it expected a public sector deficit of 15.3 billion crowns at the end of 1996, compared with its previous May 1996 prediction of a 12.0 billion crown shortfall.</p>
<p>But it cut its 1997 forecast from 9.1 billion crowns to 5.8 billion. &quot;The general tone...is slightly more optimistic,&quot; the survey said of the forecasts as a whole.</p>
<p>Other forecasts for both 1996 and 1997 presented the economy doing better than previously expected.</p>
<p>They saw unemployment, a major drain on public coffers in Denmark's lavish welfare state, at 9.0 percent by the end of 1996, compared with May projections of 9.2 percent.</p>
<p>The survey saw 8.6 percent jobless at the end of 1997, compared to a previous forecast of 8.7 percent.</p>
<p>In June 1996 actual Danish unemployment was 8.7 percent on a year-to-year basis, against 1995's average 10.3 percent.</p>
<p>The ministry also trimmed its 1996 inflation estimate to 2.0 percent from its previous estimate of 2.1 percent.</p>
<p>It said that it now expected 2.3 percent inflation in 1997, compared to earlier estimates of 2.4 percent.</p>
<p>The most bullish expectations were for the current account, now seen enjoying a 10 billion crown surplus in 1996, rising to 11.5 billion in 1997, compared to previous estimates of 8.3 billion and 10 billion.</p>
<p>The independent Economic Council -- known as the Wise Men -- last May predicted a 1997 current account surplus of 10.9 billion crowns, but warned that it would plummet to 1.8 billion the following year.</p>
<p>The economy ministry forecast is limited to 1996 and 1997.</p>
<p>The only forecast left unchanged was that for gross domestic product (GDP) growth, still expected to be 1.8 percent in 1996 and 3.0 percent in 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;These rates are slightly above expectations of growth in neighbouring countries, mainly due to the contribution from increased oil and gas production in the North Sea,&quot; the survey said.</p>
