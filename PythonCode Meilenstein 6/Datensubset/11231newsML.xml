<p>Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto begins a three-day visit to Brazil on Saturday to boost trade and strengthen ties with the world's largest Japanese community outside Japan.</p>
<p>Hashimoto is scheduled to spend Sunday in the sprawling industrial metropolis of Sao Paulo, home to most of the 1.3 million Brazilians of Japanese descent.</p>
<p>Brazil, Latin America's largest nation, will be Hashimoto's third stop on a 10-day trade and investment tour of the region that began in Mexico on Tuesday. He is Japan's first head of state to visit Brazil in almost 15 years.</p>
<p>While in Sao Paulo, Hashimoto will meet with Japanese community leaders and place flowers at a mausoleum of early Japanese immigrants, who began arriving at the turn of the century to farm Brazil's vast interior.</p>
<p>Brazil's controversial auto import rules, which have drawn fire from the United States, Japan, South Korea and the European Union, will be among the topics discussed by Hashimoto and President Fernando Henrique Cardoso in the capital of Brasilia.</p>
<p>Cardoso made an official visit to Tokyo in March, when he invited the Japanese leader to Brazil.</p>
<p>Diplomatic sources say Hashimoto feels a particular attachment to Latin America, having worked as a young man for a textile company that was active in Ecuador.</p>
<p>&quot;The whole idea (of the visits) is to show Japanese business that we think Latin America is a place that must be invested in,&quot; said a senior Japanese diplomat in the capital of Brasilia. &quot;The visit reflects our renewed confidence in Brazil.&quot;</p>
<p>Japanese investment has been flowing back to the region in recent years as Latin American nations re-establish economic credentials lost during the 1980s debt crisis and the long bouts of hyperinflation that followed in many countries. Japan's foreign direct investment in Brazil was $1.23 billion in 1994, up from just $171 million in 1991.</p>
<p>Trade between Brazil and Japan totalled $6.5 billion last year, making Brazil Japan's leading Latin American trade partner, followed by Mexico with about $5 billion.</p>
<p>Hashimoto is scheduled to leave Chile early on Saturday and fly to Brazil's spectacular Iguacu Falls, where nearly 300 waterfalls cascade over a 1,000-foot (300-metre) wide precipice at the border of Argentina, Paraguay and Brazil.</p>
<p>After visiting the nearby Itaipu hydroelectric plant, Hashimoto will fly to Sao Paulo.</p>
<p>On Sunday he will visit a museum of Japanese history in Brazil and meet with Sao Paulo state Governor Mario Covas before flying to Brasilia on Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p>On Monday, Hashimoto leaves Brazil for Peru. He then travels to Costa Rica, where he is scheduled to meet with leaders of a number of other Latin American nations.</p>
