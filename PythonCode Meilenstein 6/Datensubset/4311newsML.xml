<title>FRANCE: Bomb target sees flare-up of violence in Corsica.</title>
<headline>Bomb target sees flare-up of violence in Corsica.</headline>
<dateline>AJACCIO, Corsica 1996-08-20</dateline>
<text>
<p>A senior Corsican politician, fresh from escaping a bomb attack, said on Tuesday the French Mediterranean island was headed for a new flare-up of separatist violence which could spread to the mainland.</p>
<p>&quot;I fear that we are heading away from a peace process towards violence in Corsica as well as on the mainland,&quot; former French industry minister Jose Rossi said hours after police defused a bomb on his doorstep.</p>
<p>The device was defused on Monday night outside his Ajaccio flat after an anonymous telephone warning. Police said Rossi, who heads the elected council of southern Corsica, had been scheduled to spend the night at his flat, which is occupied by his daughter and son-in-law.</p>
<p>Hours after the attack, the first direct one against Rossi, a powerful bomb damaged the office of the central government representative in Sartene early on Tuesday, wrecking his car.</p>
<p>It was the fifth bombing of a public building on the island in just over a week.</p>
<p>No one has claimed responsibility for the attacks, but Corsican separatists seeking greater autonomy from mainland France regularly target government buildings in a guerrilla campaign that has been going on for two decades.</p>
<p>The justice ministry said last week that violence would not &quot;diminish its determination to seek out and and punish the perpetrators of terrorist acts&quot;.</p>
<p>Rossi said the flare-up of violence may stem from confusion after secret talks reported between the government and a separatist movement.</p>
<p>&quot;There must be no doublespeak which lets nationalists hope for things that we cannot give them...Nationalists also must say clearly what they want,&quot; he told France 2 television.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Alain Juppe, visiting the island last month, announced a policy of economic aid twinned with new-found toughness to restore law and order after judges on the island complained the state was too lax on guerrilla violence.</p>
