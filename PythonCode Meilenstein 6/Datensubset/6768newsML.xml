<p>An Iraqi Kurdish militia group said on Wednesday that Iranian artillery units have pounded its positions in northern Iraq in support of a rival Kurdish group, killing or wounding around 100 people.</p>
<p>&quot;The Iranian Islamic regime has entered the war on behalf of its (Patriotic Union of Kurdistan) PUK quisling,&quot; the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) said in a statement.</p>
<p>Fighting between the two Kurdish groups broke out last weekend, shattering a ceasefire brokered by the United States early last year.</p>
<p>&quot;This Iranian aggression has caused the death and injury of nearly 100 people and the displacement of tens of families,&quot; the group said. Its statement was faxed to Reuters in Ankara. The PUK was not immediately availaible for comment.</p>
<p>The KDP, led by Massoud Barzani, said Iranian forces had been firing heavy artillery and Katyusha rockets into northern Iraq from inside Iran every day since August 18.</p>
<p>It called on the Western allies who shield northern Iraq's Kurds against any attack by Baghdad to halt the shelling.</p>
<p>&quot;We appeal to member governments of Operation Provide Comfort protecting the Kurds to deter Iranian intervention in the Kurdish enclave of northern Iraq,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>A U.S., British and French air force, known as Provide Comfort, has been patrolling the skies of northern Iraq since shortly after the end of the 1991 Gulf War.</p>
<p>A small number of Iranian troops briefly entered northern Iraq last month and killed around 20 members of an Iranian Kurdish group based there.</p>
<p>The KDP, which controls the northern sector of the Kurdish-held territory in Iraq, said the heaviest Iranian shelling was on Tuesday at the village of Qasrey.</p>
<p>It said 25 KDP fighters died and nearly 75 guerrillas and civilians were injured in a four-hour bombardment. The KDP abandoned its positions there to oncoming fighters from the rival group, the statement said.</p>
