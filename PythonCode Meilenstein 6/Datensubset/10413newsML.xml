<p>Norwegian shares were unchanged on Friday despite good support for cyclical stocks and positive sentiment stemming from Germany's interest rate cut on Thursday.</p>
<p>Brokers said the market was expected to stay flat to slightly positive over the coming week in the absence of external impulses.</p>
<p>The Total share index closed 0.35 points up at 286.03 points in turnover of 635 million crowns.</p>
<p>&quot;There was really nothing happening today,&quot; said one dealer. &quot;The market's feeling is good following the rate cut yesterday but there were no impulses. Anyway it's Friday.&quot;</p>
<p>Demand remained healthy for insurance group UNI Storebrand which climbed a further 0.40 crowns to 35.90 crowns in trade worth 73.5 million crowns.</p>
<p>UNI has climbed 1.50 crowns, or nearly 4.4 percent since Wednesday, on buying interest from mainly overseas investors.</p>
