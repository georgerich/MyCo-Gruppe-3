<p>Hurricane Dolly weakened rapidly as it moved over land in Mexico Friday and was downgraded to a tropical storm with maximum winds of 55 mph (88 kph), but threatened flash floods and mudslides in mountainous areas, the Naitonal Hurricane Center said.</p>
<p>Tropical Storm Edouard, moving through the Atlantic Ocean, strengthened but remained far from land and was a threat only to shipping interests.  </p>
<p>At 1400 EDT/1800 GMT, the center of Tropical Storm Dolly was located at latitude 21.9 north, longitude 99.0 west, about 75 miles west-southwest of Tampico, Mexico, and was moving west-northwest at 13 mph (21 kph).</p>
<p>A hurricane warning for coastal areas of Mexico was discontinued.</p>
<p>Forecasters said they expected Dolly to continue weakening as it moved into the mountains, but residents were warned to be alert for torrential rains and life-threatening flash floods. The storm could dump six to 12 inches (15-30 cm) of rain on parts of Mexico, they said.</p>
<p>Tropical Storm Edouard strengthened, and forecasters said it could become a hurricane later on Friday.</p>
<p>At 1100, the center of Edouard was located at latitude 13.9 north, longitude 39.1 west, about 1,500 miles (2,400 km) east of the Lesser Antilles and moving west at 15 mph (24 kph).</p>
<p>Maximum sustained winds had climbed to 70 mph (112 kph), just 5 mph (8 kph) below hurricane strength.</p>
