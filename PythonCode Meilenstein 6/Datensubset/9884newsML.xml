<p>Fourteen members of a pro-India militant group were found dead on Thursday in south Kashmir, police said.</p>
<p>The bullet-riddled bodies of the victims, all members of the Muslim Mujahideen outfit, were discovered in Anantnag district, about 50 km (30 miles) southeast of Srinagar, the summer capital of troubled Jammu and Kashmir state, they said.  </p>
<p>Police said all 14 bodies were found in a house in the Mattan Chowk area of Anantnag town. Authorities said no one had claimed responsibility for the killings but they suspected separatist guerrillas.</p>
<p>Muslim Mujahideen is one of several groups, comprised of former separatist militants, which back Indian rule in the province.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Muslim Mujahideen chief Nabi Azad told a news conference in Srinagar that his group would not participate in coming local assembly elections in the Jammu and Kashmir state.</p>
<p>The assembly elections, set to be held on four days next month starting on September 7, would be the first local elections in the state since a separatist revolt against Indian rule in the mostly Moslem state erupted in 1990.</p>
