<headline>Dow ends lower as tobacco shares again hammered.</headline>

<p>U.S. blue chips snapped a three-day winning streak as Philip Morris and other tobacco stocks bowed under the weight of mounting industry lawsuits and signs of increased government oversight.</p>
<p>&quot;Philip Morris is accounting for the cloud over the market,&quot; said Alan Ackerman, a Fahnestock market strategist.</p>
<p>The Dow industrials lost 31 to about 5690 after climbing 56 points over the past three sessions. Philip Morris lost 3-7/8 to 87-5/8, accounting for more than one-third of the Dow's losses.  </p>
<p>Tobacco shares were already under pressure Wednesday by news that Michigan became the 13th state to sue the industry and as a key cigarette trial in Indianapolis was nearing an end. But a blue-chip rally from lows was nipped by late news that President Clinton plans on Friday to accept an FDA recommendation that tobacco be regulated as a drug.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems to be one problem after another. It's a negative for Philip Morris and other tobacco stocks but I don't think it'll affect the rest of the market,&quot; said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp.  </p>
<p>Ackerman said, &quot;There's no telling how investors will value tobacco stocks from here on in. It's certainly not an area where an investor can jump in.&quot;</p>
<p>Investors are still mindful of the stiff selling in tobacco shares in the wake of an August 8 Florida jury ruling against the industry in a suit filed by a smoker.</p>
<p>Among tobacco shares, RJR Nabisco, parent of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, lost 1-1/8 to 25-3/8, smokeless tobacco maker UST Inc fell 7/8 to 30-7/8 and Loews lost 1-1/4 to 76-5/8.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, late aggressive buying in technology issues spurred the Nasdaq Composite to rise two to 1127.  </p>
<p>IBM rose 1-7/8 to 112-3/8, Intel added 3/4 to 80-1/4 and Cisco Systems added 1-1/4 to 56-1/4.</p>
<p>But the broader market remained weaker with losers beating gainers 6-5 on moderate NYSE volume of about 346 million.</p>
<p>&quot;We're operating in a vaccuum. The only thing to stimulate stocks is bonds,&quot; said Larry Wachtel, a Prudential Securities market analyst. &quot;There's not much volume, not many players and not much conviction.&quot;</p>
<p>The long bond slumped 1/2 point to yield 6.84 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;We had basic profit-taking in stocks,&quot; said Peter Cardillo, director of research of Westfalia Investments.  </p>
<p>But tobacco stocks nonetheless remained a focus, with players awaiting the outcome of the Marion County Superior Court case. The jury is expected to get the case Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;If they win, tobacco stocks will be saved. If not, tobacco stocks will get another whacking,&quot; Wachtel said.</p>
<p>Among individual stocks, Newbridge Networks jumped 11 to 59-3/8 in NYSE trading after the company laid to rest lingering investor fears with a solid first-quarter report.</p>
<p>J.P. Morgan upgraded Newbridge to buy from market performer and Cowen raised 1997 and 1998 earnings estimates.</p>
<p>Jenny Craig slumped 5-7/8 to 11-3/8.  </p>
<p>After Tuesday's close, the company blamed new weight-loss drugs for recent soft demand during the normally slow summer period. CS First Boston cut the stock to hold from buy.</p>
<p>Rexene Corp fell 2-1/4 to 10-1/2 after privately held Huntsman Corp announced late Tuesday that it was withdrawing its unsolicited $460 million bid for the chemical firm.</p>
<p>Oracle lost 1-1/8 to 37-7/8. Goldman Sachs downgraded the stock to its recommended list due to its sharp price appreciation. The stock had been on Goldman's priority list for about one year.  </p>
<p>Diana Corp climbed 8-7/8 to 30-1/8. The stock has been volatile, swept higher and knocked lower as an Internet play. Diana said it knew of no reason for Wednesday's stock rise.</p>
<p>Genesis Health rose 2-1/8 to 24-1/2. Merrill Lynch named Genesis its Focus One stock of the week.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq Composite rose 2.17 to 1126.84.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 index fell 0.62 to 665.07.</p>
