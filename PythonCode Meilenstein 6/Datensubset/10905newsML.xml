<headline>LME slow, copper lifted by covering by close.</headline>

<p>Base metals by the close of Friday's London Metal Exchange (LME) floor trading remained uninspiring, though book squaring ahead of the long U.K. holiday weekend helped to move copper higher.</p>
<p>Traders said bouts of short covering lifted copper from a low of $1,932 to $1,949, a $14 gain from Thursday, though the market never seriously attempted to break from its recent well-worn range of between $1,900 and $1,970.</p>
<p>&quot;Overall copper market activity has been dire,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>He believed the lack of market moving news and strong physical interest may continue after the U.K Monday holiday.</p>
<p>There will be no LME stocks report on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The next return will be on Friday August 30.</p>
<p>Other metals remained sluggish depite the uptick in the copper market.</p>
<p>Nickel maintained levels above $7,400 amid short covering following its recent robust chart performance. But overhead selling and profit-taking restricted further gains.</p>
<p>Nickel was last at $7,430, up $70.</p>
<p>Trade selling in thin trading knocked zinc by $6 to $1,024, while lead dipped by $11 to $807.</p>
<p>Aluminium slipped to test support levels, though found some solace from light consumer demand. It was last at $1,478, against $1,487.</p>
<p>Tin moved $5 higher to $6,170, while alloy was last quoted at $1,280/90, against $1,285.</p>
