<p>Russia's acting commander in Chechnya, General Konstantin Pulikovsky, vowed on Tuesday to drive Chechen rebels from the capital Grozny and said he would use aircraft and heavy artillery to do it.</p>
<p>But rebel chief-of-staff, Aslan Maskhadov appealed to Kremlin security supremo Alexander Lebed to prevent Pulikovsky's troops from using force to sweep his separatist fighters from the battered city.</p>
<p>Interfax news agency quoted Maskhadov as saying President Boris Yeltsin's special envoy in Chechnya should &quot;use all of his influence to stop the approaching madness&quot;.</p>
<p>Pulikovsky told Interfax news agency: &quot;Grozny will without fail be cleared of rebel fighters.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We do not intend to put up with the brazen and barbaric actions of illegal groups who are continuing to shoot down our helicopters, carry out bold acts of sabotage and surround Russian servicemen.&quot;</p>
<p>The rebels, who seek independence for their mountainous Caucasus territory, swept into Grozny on August 6, seizing key buildings and trapping Russian soldiers in their checkpoints and in the central government complex.</p>
<p>Pulikovsky on Monday gave civilians 48 hours to leave before he unleashes an all-out bombardment and he added on Tuesday that the situation could only be resolved by force.</p>
<p>Itar-Tass news agency quoted Pulikovsky as saying artillery had already opened up in Grozny with &quot;pinpoint strikes&quot; against the rebels, although aviation was not being used.</p>
<p>Pulikovsky's views are in sharp contrast with those of Lebed, who has been talking to rebel leaders and opposes the use of aircraft.</p>
<p>Lebed won guarded approval from rebel leaders in two visits to Chechnya last week. His spokesman told Tass on Monday, before the army threat, that Lebed opposed bombing.</p>
<p>&quot;Aerial bombardment as a military method of settling the problem, even with the evacuation of civilians, will lead only to widening the conflict zone,&quot; the spokesman, Alexander Barkhatov, quoted Lebed as saying.</p>
<p>Russian helicopters, used in recent days for rocket attacks om Grozny, dropped leaflets over the city on Tuesday containing Pulikovsky's warning.</p>
<p>In the leaflets the general accused the guerrillas of using a ceasefire to dig in and maintain an offensive to try to win the 20-month-old war by force.</p>
<p>&quot;On expiry of this deadline, I maintain my right to use all the forces and means available, including bombers and ground-attack aircraft, and also multiple rocket launchers and artillery to strike at the guerrillas' positions,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Pulikovsky, who met Maskhadov twice last week to arrange the latest shaky truce, said he was sure of the backing of Russia's leaders. He said he was acting &quot;in the interests of the state&quot;.</p>
<p>The Kremlin and the army have sounded different notes on Chechnya in the past. Yeltsin, trying to end the war before the presidential election in July, ordered a halt to an offensive in March, but the generals continued bombarding Chechen villages.</p>
<p>Yeltsin won a lull with a ceasefire in May, but shortly after his re-election the army went on the offensive again and the rebels say that provoked their raid on Grozny.</p>
<p>Rebel leaders have frequently complained that there is a &quot;party of war&quot; in the Kremlin which is overruling peace efforts.</p>
<p>Lebed's appointment in June was followed by the ejection of leading Kremlin hawks. But a deeply tired Yeltsin, who has been out of sight for weeks, has so far refused Lebed's latest demand, that he sack Interior Minister General Anatoly Kulikov.</p>
