<p>The Amsterdam Stock Exchange said on Wednesday it was considering proposals to revamp the illiquid, unlisted Dutch securities market as part of discussions on the high-growth company segment of the exchange.</p>
<p>Spokesman Thom Hoedemakers told Reuters the exchange was closely following developments in European small company, high growth stock exchange initiatives such as the Alternative Investment Market in London and the Nouveau Marche in France.</p>
<p>&quot;It has our interest and we're following developments so in the near future we will have a clear view of these markets,&quot; said Hoedemakers.</p>
<p>The review of the Dutch unlisted securities market follows proposals submitted by the market's two principal brokers, AOT and Van der Moolen, aimed at improving efficiency and liquidity.</p>
<p>&quot;In the past year we have sat with the exchange to see if we could bring that segment of the market within the protection of the regulation of the exchange and also to enable more liquidity there,&quot; said Van der Moolen vice-chairman Peter van der Lugt.</p>
<p>He added revitalisation of the market may attract new firms.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course we hope that a good functioning of this secondary market for small caps will be to make it appealing for new companies to come to this market,&quot; said Van der Lugt.</p>
<p>Around 20 to 30 companies are actively traded on the unlisted securities market, with average turnover of between 1,000 and 10,000 shares a day each, according to AOT general manager Jos Dreesens.</p>
<p>Inefficient delivery systems, often involving physical transportation of bearer shares, and complicated registration procedures mean AOT and Van Der Moolen cannot even cover costs.</p>
<p>Proposals to boost efficiency include improving delivery systems and allowing the brokers to deal directly with the public, said Dreesens.</p>
<p>&quot;A simpler system where transfer of shares can be done by a clearing system would keep costs lower and make the market more attractive for the public...It may also attract other companies to list their shares in this over-the-counter market,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Under present rules, AOT and Van der Moolen can deal only with members of the stock exchange, adding to costs.</p>
<p>The stock exchange's Hoedemakers said September was the earliest a decision could be taken on the proposals.</p>
<p>He denied a reorganisation of the market would result in a system akin to the old parallel market, which acted as a half-way house for companies aiming at a full bourse listing. It was abolished in 1994.</p>
<p>&quot;We learnt much from the parallel market experience and we'll bear that in mind, but in the end I think we will choose a modern approach,&quot; Hoedemakers said.</p>
