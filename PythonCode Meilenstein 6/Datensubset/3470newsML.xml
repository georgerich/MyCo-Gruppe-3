<p>The value of consents for non-residential buildings continues at high levels, with consents with a total value of NZ$221.3 million authorised in June 1996, Statistics New Zealand said on Wednesday.  </p>
<p>January and February 1996 were the only months in the last year for which a greater value was recorded, SNZ said.</p>
<p>The June figure for non-residential buildings was 39.5 percent higher than the year ago figure.  </p>
<p>It included NZ$49.1 million for factories and industrial buildings, $45.1 million for shops, restaurants and taverns, $28.8 million for education buildings, $25.3 million for storage buildings, and $25.0 million for offices and administration buildings.</p>
<p>Consents for 1,685 new dwelling units were authorised in June 1996. The short-term trend estimate for new dwelling units fell 1.5 percent from May 1996 to June 1996. It peaked in April 1996 after increasing steadily since September 1995.  </p>
<p>The national median consent value for new dwelling units authorised in June was NZ$115,000. This is an increase of 6.5 percent when compared with the year ago figure.</p>
<p>The total value of consents for residential buildings (new dwellings and outbuildings plus alterations and additions) in June was $274.2 million.</p>
<p>The total value of consents for the year ended June 1996 for all buildings was $5.81 billion, an increase of 5.2 percent on the year ended June 1995.</p>
