<p>Taiwan's state-owned Chinese Petroleum Corp said on Thursday that it hoped to continue oil exploration in Ecuador despite Quito's decision to revise foreign firms' oil contracts.</p>
<p>&quot;We have yet to receive any notice from Ecuador, but Chinese Petroleum will try to stay there to continue its oil exploration projects,&quot; company oil exploration director Yeh Tien-shun said.</p>
<p>Yeh said Taiwan's oil monopoly would study any regulatory changes made by the Ecuador government.</p>
<p>CPC has operations in Ecuador's Block 16 with daily oil production of 30,000 barrels, and in Block 17, which has yet to produce, Yeh said.</p>
<p>The head of state oil company Petroecuador, Patricio Lopez, said earlier this week that the government would revise all contracts with foreign companies extracting crude from Ecuadoran soil &quot;so that each one becomes a benefit for the state.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Each company is a separate problem and we have to revise each one of them,&quot; said Lopez.</p>
<p>President Abdala Bucaram on Wednesday ordered a ban on production by Maxus Energy, owned by Argentine oil giant YPF SA, until it agreed to joint ventures with the state oil firm.  </p>
<p>Yeh agreed that foreign investment must bring benefits to the local economy.</p>
<p>&quot;Foreign investors like Chinese Petroleum should include plans to benefit the local people,&quot; Yeh said.</p>
<p>Another CPC official said it was unlikely the Ecuadoran army would occupy Block 16, despite news reports that it might.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no need for Ecuador's government to use the army to occupy any block,&quot; Chinese Petroleum official Liao Pai-fon said. &quot;We will wait and see what deals the Ecuador government wants to reach.&quot; -- Taipei Newsroom (2-5080815)</p>
