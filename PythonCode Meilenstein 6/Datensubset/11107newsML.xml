<headline>Russians, Chechens say observing Grozny ceasefire.</headline>
<dateline>GROZNY, Russia 1996-08-23</dateline>

<p>Rebel fighters and Russian soldiers said a ceasefire effective at noon (0800 GMT) on Friday was being generally observed, although scattered gunfire echoed through the Chechen capital Grozny.</p>
<p>The Russian army said earlier it was preparing to withdraw from the rebel-dominated southern mountains of the region as part of the peace deal reached with separatists on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;There has been some shooting from their side but it has been relatively quiet,&quot; said fighter Aslan Shabazov, a bearded man wearing a white t-shirt and camoflage trousers.</p>
<p>Soon after he spoke another burst of gunfire rocked the courtyard where the rebels had set up their base and a captured Russian T-72 tank roared out to investigate.</p>
<p>The separatists, who swept into Grozny on August 6, still control large areas of the centre of town, and Russian soldiers are based at checkpoints on the approach roads.</p>
<p>&quot;The ceasefire is being observed,&quot; said woman soldier Svetlana Goncharova, 35, short dark hair poking out from under a peaked camouflage cap.</p>
<p>A few helicopters flew overhead, firing off flares, but there was no shooting from the air.</p>
<p>The truce, the latest of several, was agreed in talks on Thursday between Russian peacemaker Alexander Lebed and rebel chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov.</p>
<p>The two also agreed to set up joint patrols in Grozny, but Goncharova said she was sceptical about whether this could work.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to try it, but I doubt if this is possible with the separatists,&quot; she said.</p>
