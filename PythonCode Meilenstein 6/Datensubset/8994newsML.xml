<headline>UK grain futures mixed, tender viewed as neutral.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-08-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>UK grain futures closed mixed on Thursday on a market that traders felt had run of steam.</p>
<p>They said the result of the European Union (EU) weekly tender was neutral.</p>
<p>The market had tried to go down at the opening but business almost ground to a halt as prices returned to about unchanged following reports of the bids at this week tender, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;Some people were surprised by the fact the European trade was willing to pay tax at 3.08 Ecus and that brought the market to a stop,&quot; said a trader.</p>
<p>European grain exporters bid through France for 323,750 tonnes of soft wheat at 3.08 Ecus tax and 3.27 Ecus refund. The Commission granted 145,350 tonnes of soft wheat at 1.27 Ecus.</p>
<p>At the close of business in the wheat market most positions were bid up, but sellers had disappeared.</p>
<p>Closing values were 0.60 stg up to 0.40 stg down on a turnover of 366 lots.</p>
<p>Barley closed unchanged to 0.50 stg up after trading 278 lots.</p>
<p>Amsterdam milling wheat futures closed unchanged and tradeless.</p>
<p>Traders on the UK fob market reported no business while delivered trade was slow.</p>
<p>&quot;The futures market messed us up. We started the day well as the futures dropped but as soon as they went back up buyers got cold feet,&quot; said a trader.</p>
