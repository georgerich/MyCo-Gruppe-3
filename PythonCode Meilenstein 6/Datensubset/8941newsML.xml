<p>European stocks and the dollar bounded upward on Thursday after the German central bank surprised financial markets by making a much greater than expected cut in its key money market interest rate.</p>
<p>The Bundesbank triggered a series of rate cuts across Europe by slicing 0.3 of a percentage point off its securities repurchase rate, or repo, to an historic low of 3.0 percent. It left the official Lombard and Discount rates unchanged.</p>
<p>The Bank of France followed quickly by lowering its intervention rate to 3.35 percent from 3.55 and then Belgium, the Netherlands and Austria acted to trim their rates.</p>
<p>Equity markets, which had traded cautiously through the morning as the German central bankers met, rose immediately after the Frankfurt news as investors cheered their cut as a positive move for stocks.</p>
<p>The dollar reacted by rising rapidly through 1.49 marks and to around 108.40 yen, while the mark slipped against other European currencies.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a clear signal by the Bundesbank that it wants a weaker deutschemark -- today's easing is much larger than anticipated,&quot; said Nick Stamenkovic, economist at DKB International in London.</p>
<p>By 1430 GMT the dollar was at 1.4945 marks and 108.54 yen, up from 1.4817 marks and 108.34 yen at the close on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Bundesbank cut was far beyond what was expected by the markets, but central bank president Hans Tiemeyer said a slowdown in German money supply growth and low inflation had allowed the short-term rate to be shaved.</p>
<p>&quot;Now we intend to watch and await further developments for some time. We believe that we have created clarity for the time being...The Bundesbank doesn't follow a short-term policy but follows a steady policy,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>M3 monetary data early this week raised hopes of a repo cut, but prospects had waned before the Bundesbank met after a business climate index released on Wednesday indicated the economy was in better shape than many had thought. &quot;The move was surprisingly aggressive and must in part reflect the slowdown in M3,&quot; said Jeremy Hawkins, senior economic adviser at BankAmerica.</p>
<p>German shares, which had stalled a few points adrift before the rates news, climbed back into positive territory with the bluechip DAX index closing floor trade 13.52 points higher at 2,557.26. In later screen-based trade, the IBIS DAX index was nearly 25 points up at 2,559.42 by 1430 GMT.</p>
<p>French shares also rose strongly but later came off a few points after Wall Street opened steady and traded higher.</p>
<p>&quot;The Bundesbank has once again taken the markets by surprise because since yesterday nobody was still expecting a cut,&quot; said Jacques-Antoine Bretteil, a director at brokers Leven in Paris.</p>
<p>London shares, which had spent the morning either side of their opening level, jumped on the Bundesbank news and the FTSE index was 15.8 points up at 3,887.9 as the market went into the last hour of trading.</p>
<p>Although government bond futures rose, Ian Williams of Panmure Gordon said the chances of Britain making another rate cut have decreased after recent strong economic data.</p>
