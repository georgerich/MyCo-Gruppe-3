<p>Israel's housing ministry is drafting a plan to approve construction of 5,000 new homes in the Palestinian occupied West Bank, a spokesman said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;We are speaking about a plan of 20,000 apartments in central Israel, about 5,000 of which would fall east of the Green Line,&quot; housing spokesman Amir Dobkin told Reuters.</p>
<p>The Green Line was the Jewish state's eastern border before Israel occupied the West Bank in the 1967 Middle East war.</p>
<p>Dobkin said that Deputy Housing Minister Meir Porush described the old border as &quot;theoretical&quot; and wanted it erased.</p>
<p>He said the homes would be built by the private sector but that government funds could be used for infrastructure if necessary.</p>
<p>The spokesman said the plan was under preparation and would be presented to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government for approval later in the year.</p>
<p>&quot;We are pretty sure the plan will be accepted,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Netanyahu's office declined comment on the plan and said it would clarify its stance upon receiving the proposal.</p>
<p>In a move that angered Palestinians, Israeli Defence Minister Yitzhak Mordechai this month approved placing 298 mobile homes in Jewish settlements on occupied lands.</p>
<p>The move was the government's first action on settlements since Netanyahu in August lifted a freeze on settlement building in the West Bank imposed by the previous government which made peace deals with the Palestine Liberation Organisation.</p>
<p>Palestinians, who hope to eventually establish an independent state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, regard the 130,000 Jews living amidst nearly two million Palestinians in those areas as an obstacle to peace.</p>
