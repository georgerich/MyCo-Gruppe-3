<p>Vietnam sentenced a prominent dissident to two years' jail on Thursday and imposed suspended sentences on two others, court sources said.</p>
<p>Le Hong Ha, a former high-ranking Communist Party member, was sentenced to two years in prison. Ha Si Phu, a leading academic, and outspoken communist Nguyen Kien Giang, were given suspended sentences of a year and 15 months respectively.</p>
<p>(Corrects background descriptions of Le Hong Ha and Ha Si Phu, which had been transposed.)</p>
<p>The sources said all three men had been accused of divulging state secrets. Foreign correspondents were not allowed to attend the trial and further details were not immediately available.</p>
<p>Officials were also not available on Thursday evening to confirm the outcome of the one-day trial.</p>
<p>Le Hong Ha and Ha Si Phu were arrested late last year during a broader crackdown on dissent in the run-up to Vietnam's Eighth Communist Party Congress.</p>
<p>Phu (corrects from Ha) was said to have openly criticised Hanoi during an interview with a foreign radio station.</p>
<p>Ha (corrects from Phu) had been expelled from the Communist Party earlier in the year after voicing support for another dissident, Hoang Minh Chinh.</p>
<p>Nguyen Kien Giang was investigated for possessing state secrets a few weeks later, but had not been taken into custody.</p>
<p>It had not been clear in advance of Thursday's trial whether he would be sentenced alongside Ha and Phu.</p>
<p>The event had been condemned earlier in the day by human rights group Amnesty International, which said Le Hong Ha and Ha Si Phu were being punished &quot;only for questioning the political views of the Vietnamese government&quot;.</p>
