<headline>LCE cocoa ends at top of range as rally stalls.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-08-20</dateline>

<p>London cocoa futures ended at the top of their range after relatively active buying but traders noted little follow through to carry the market to new high ground.</p>
<p>One trading house was leading bids on the second-month December contract, lifting it to a high of 1,043 stg in the morning but the rally stalled in the afternoon when activity was mixed.</p>
<p>&quot;It's still in a tiny range between 1,020 and 1,040,&quot; said one trader. &quot;We saw a bit of buying but it dried up.&quot;</p>
<p>December closed 15 stg higher on the day at 1,040 stg a tonne -- a level which is seen as technically encouraging.</p>
<p>September was more subdued, ending only five stg higher at 1,019 stg, and traders said one explanation could be that it was kept in check by options players before the expiry on Wednesday.</p>
<p>This led to the Sept/Dec switch being traded at a 20-stg discount after a 12-stg discount on Monday.</p>
<p>Some traders expected holders of 1,050 stg calls to exercise their options, a move which could lead to short-covering. But others said the expiry was likely to go smoothly without many out-of-the-money declarations. Turnover was relatively good at 5,160 lots, mainly on the December contract. AA business was reported on September.</p>
<p>There was no fundamental news, but the next round of West African pod counts expected from the end of August may shed light on the impact of July rains.</p>
<p>The close at 1,040 stg is seen technically stimulating but analysts expect a band of overhead resistance up to $1,080 to pressurise the market.</p>
