<p>Terror has gripped Grozny in the face of a threatened Russian bombardment to drive out rebels who humiliated Moscow by seizing the Chechen capital.</p>
<p>Russian security supremo Alexander Lebed, instructed to restore order in the city overrun by rebels after a raid on August 6, planned to visit the region on Wednesday in an apparent a last-ditch attempt to avert further bloodshed.</p>
<p>With President Boris Yeltsin holidaying hundreds of km (miles) northwest of Moscow in the Valdai lakeland, Lebed's policy-making Security Council fuelled speculation on who was running Russia by expressing doubt that the president was directly involved in finalising his last order on Chechnya.</p>
<p>But Yeltsin's office, already busy denying a new rash of rumours about Yeltsin's health focused on his heart problems, also insisted that the order was fully in line with the president's wishes.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of people have fled Grozny to beat the August 22 deadline, when Russian commander Konstantin Pulikovsky says he will use warplanes and heavy artillery to clear rebels from the capital of the mostly-Moslem southern region.</p>
<p>Russian forces have been trying to stop the separatists' independence bid since December 1994 in fighting which has killed more than 30,000 people, mostly civilians.</p>
<p>Liberals have called on Yeltsin to avert the threatened attack, which Yelena Bonner, widow of former Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov, said would be a &quot;crime against humanity&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems Boris Yeltsin is unable to and does not want to stop the monstrous crime which is being prepared,&quot; Bonner told Ekho Moskvy news agency on Tuesday.</p>
<p>About half Grozny's population of 400,000 is estimated to have either fled or died since Yeltsin sent his forces in.</p>
<p>Much of the city was destroyed at the start of 1995 as federal forces bombed the rebels out of Grozny, killing thousands of civilians in the process.</p>
<p>Though many have fled in recent days, tens of thousands remain, and their chances of escape decreased on Tuesday when Russian soldiers blocked one of the few points of passage.</p>
<p>The troops apparently aimed to close the route to Chechen fighters. But they stranded civilians in an area between rebel and Russian lines which has been shelled heavily in recent days.</p>
<p>About 30 soldiers with armoured personnel carriers (APCs) swept through the dusty village of Alkhan-Yurt on the southwest fringe of Grozny and took up positions near a ramshackle bridge.</p>
<p>&quot;They started shooting up the bridge with grenades when they got down there and everyone turned back,&quot; said one woman who managed to cross from the Grozny side just before the Russians moved in. Sporadic explosions could be heard from the vicinity.</p>
<p>Western journalists who visited the bridge in the early evening saw the bodies of two civilians on the Grozny side.</p>
<p>The troops' arrival halted the flow of refugees, many of them old folk who had hobbled for several kilometres.</p>
<p>The soldiers searched refugees and forced men to lie on the ground. A number said they were robbed of some of the few possesions they managed to take along as they fled their homes.</p>
<p>One of the APCs trained its cannon on us.</p>
<p>&quot;Out of the car!&quot; screamed one of the blue-camouflaged soldiers, sticking his Kalashnikov assault rifle in my face.</p>
<p>&quot;You damn journalists! Don't you have enough blacks in your own country? You've come here to defend these black arses we're trying to wipe out. I could kill you now if I wanted to,&quot; he told me, prodding my stomach with the barrel of the gun.</p>
<p>Russian troops use such racist terms for the dark-skinned peoples of the Caucasus, including Chechens.</p>
<p>Unlike the first days of the exodus from Grozny, when most were young or middle-aged who found cars, buses, even donkey carts to cram into, a great number are now frail elderly people on foot who had waited until the last moment to get out.</p>
<p>Many in the chaotic crowd were driving cattle or bent over in exhaustion by the roadside under a blazing sun. Black smoke from fires burning in Grozny rose in the sky over their heads.</p>
<p>&quot;I didn't want to leave home but everyone says they are going to bomb everything in the city,&quot; said a toothless old man with one leg whom we gave a lift to.</p>
<p>A plump old woman, tears streaming down her cheeks, confronted the soldiers. &quot;Why do you want to kill us?&quot; she said.</p>
<p>The sea of agonised faces was broken by a single crazed smile -- a mentally handicapped man being pushed through the dust in a wheelchair.</p>
