<p>Military-ruled African oil giant Nigeria is getting tough with foreign oil companies it says are cheating it out of its rightful share of wealth.</p>
<p>Late on Thursday oil minister Dan Etete told assembled executives of the major companies in Lagos that rules would be strictly enforced to redress the perceived imbalance.</p>
<p>&quot;The government and people of Nigeria are not getting their fair share out of the joint venture arrangements for petroleum exploration and production,&quot; Etete said.</p>
<p>&quot;Inequalities and and anomalies which have almost made Nigeria the laughing stock of the international petroleum industry have to be eliminated.&quot;</p>
<p>Africa's most populous nation is reliant on the two million barrels of crude oil it pumps every day for around 95 percent of export earnings.</p>
<p>Etete said the joint ventures would now have to set up escrow accounts, which would allow the government to keep a closer eye on where contributions to production and exploration costs were going.</p>
<p>The five largest ventures in Nigeria are subsidiaries of Shell, Mobil, Chevron, Agip and Elf, operated in conjunction with the state-run Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).</p>
<p>The companies have in the past clashed with the government over the amount that needs to be paid for production and exploration.</p>
<p>Until now joint venture partners have presented bills to the government based on the amount they say they have spent.</p>
<p>To increase Nigerian participation in the industry Etete said oil industry contracts would have to be handed out to locally-registered companies. He bemoaned the loss of tax revenues to foreign-employed oil service companies.</p>
<p>He also said that joint venture partners would have to recruit Nigerian staff wherever possible in preference to foreigners.</p>
<p>All expatriate staff will have to be approved by National Petroleum Investment Management Services, the government's management agency for the joint ventures.</p>
<p>&quot;No wages shall be sanctioned in the case of any expatriate whose engagement did not meet with NAPIMS's prior approval,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Heavily indebted Nigeria has yet to emerge from an economic quagmire since a wave of strikes and protests in 1994, which followed the annulment of presidential elections in 1993 that would have ended ten years of army rule.</p>
<p>Etete said the government planned to open up marginal fields not currently being developed inside the main oil companies' concessions, and hand them over to those who are &quot;seriously interested in exploiting them.&quot;</p>
<p>The marginal fields are estimated to hold reserves of 800 million barrels out of a total Nigerian reserve put above 21 billion barrels.</p>
<p>&quot;These measures are not new and not unusual in the industry. the focus is to ensure that the existing laws, which are not different from what obtains in the rest of the world are fully enforced,&quot; Etete said.</p>
