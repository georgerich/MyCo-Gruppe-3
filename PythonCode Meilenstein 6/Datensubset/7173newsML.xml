<p>Following are some of the leading stories in Norwegian papers this morning:</p>
<p>AFTENPOSTEN</p>
<p>-Energy Minister Jens Stoltenberg has asked companies and households to save electricity. The risk of a lack of power next winter and higher imports has led to very high spot electricity prices. At the same time demand has grown. Stoltenberg hopes that restrictions on consumption will not be necessary.</p>
<p>-So far in 1996, new shares worth 3.7 billion crowns have been issued on the Oslo Bourse, the highest figure among the Nordic stock exchanges.</p>
<p>-Swedish telecommunications company Telia and Dutch-owned computer group Cinet are establishing a telecommunications and data network in competition with Norway's state-owned Telenor. Telenor's monopoly on a full range of telecommunications services will end in 1998.</p>
<p>DAGENS NAERINGSLIV</p>
<p>-High power prices could force Norwegian metals producer Elkem ASA to shut down production in Norway and move to the U.S. &quot;We are not going to buy power at these high prices,&quot; Ole Enger, Elkem Managing Director, says. On Tuesday Elkem booked a 33 percent rise in pre-tax profits in the first half of 1996 but said it expected a decline in most of its markets in the latter half of the year.</p>
<p>-Four of the biggest Norwegian savings banks will take on a common name, profile, marketing policy and technology in the second half of the year. The banks will still have separate boards of directors, but will operate as a common unit.</p>
