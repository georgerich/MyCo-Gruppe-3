<headline>INSTANT VIEW - UK July retail sales data.</headline>

<p>Following is a selection of economists' reactions to UK July retail sales data, showing a month-on-month fall of 0.6 percent and a year-on-year rise of 2.2 percent.</p>
<p>DAVID COLEMAN, CIBC WOOD GUNDY</p>
<p>&quot;This is certainly a lot weaker than the market expected. If you take the two months together, June and July, we've got very modest growth indeed. So it's very good news for the financial markets.&quot;  </p>
<p>ANDREW MILLIGAN, GENERAL ACCIDENT</p>
<p>&quot;What is important to look at is the three-month underlying trend, which on these figures will probably be about one percent still, depending on backward revisions. That is still showing a strong upward trend. These are very surprising numbers because we did see some very extensive price discounting in July.&quot;  </p>
<p>JEREMY HAWKINS, BANK OF AMERICA</p>
<p>&quot;What could have been the final nail in the coffin of UK base rate cut hopes instead may have opened the lid. Retail sales were unexpectedly weak in July, down some 0.6 percent. Even allowing for a likely retracement from the distorted June data, this is a surpriinsingly large decline. Moreover, breakdown is only partially reassuring...Data inevitably reflect an unwinding of Euro 96 effects, but we would still have expected nothing less than flat...While risks of a base rate cut at the September 4 Clarke-George meeting have clearly increased, we still see the odds against.&quot;  </p>
<p>WARWICK LIGHTFOOT, ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND</p>
<p>&quot;This figure is dramatically weaker than we were expecting...Retail sales is a volatile series subject to revision and heavily influenced by the seasonal adjustment. There are good grounds for treating this data with caution. These figures, combined with yesterday's weaker than expected M4 data and the weak manufacturing sector, will make it easier for the Chancellor to resist the Bank of England and mean that a further base rate cut is seriously on the agenda at the next monetary meeting on September 4.&quot;</p>
