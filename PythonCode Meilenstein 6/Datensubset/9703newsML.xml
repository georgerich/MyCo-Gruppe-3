<p>The people of Belgium on Thursday buried two eight-year-old girls starved to death by a local paedophile gang as detectives resumed their investigation into the fate of two other kidnap victims.</p>
<p>The bodies of Melissa Russo and Julie Lejeune, contained in two small white coffins, were laid to rest after a public memorial service in their home town of Liege attended by thousands both inside and outside the Saint Martin basilica.</p>
<p>Belgians across the country observed a minute's silence.</p>
<p>The outpouring of national grief since the girls' bodies were found last weekend surpassed the mourning after the death of much-loved King Baudouin three years ago.</p>
<p>People along the route to and from the church stopped work and many wept at the sight of the hearses covered in flowers.</p>
<p>During the two-hour service the girls' parents repeatedly broke down. Their lawyer Victor Hissel, himself a father of two, gave voice to national sentiment when he praised the parents for having dealt with &quot;this hell and agony&quot; with dignity.</p>
<p>Other speakers expressed anger at the injustice done.</p>
<p>There were wreaths from the Belgian government and from King Albert and Queen Paola.</p>
<p>After the service Paul Marchal, father of An Marchal -- one of two young girls still missing -- hugged Jean-Denis Lejeune who had struggled to contain his emotions during the mass, hiding his eyes behind black glasses. The crowd applauded warmly.</p>
<p>Melissa and Julie -- close friends, who were snatched as they were out for a stroll in June 1995 -- were buried side by side away from the public eye at a cemetery near their homes.</p>
<p>The mother of Eefje Lambrecks, who has been missing along with An Marchal for exactly one year, also attended the service and was cheered and applauded by the crowd.</p>
<p>The Marchals, the Lambrecks and Michel Bourlet, the public prosecutor in charge of the case, all remain hopeful that the two girls can be found alive.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope An and Eefje met Julie and Melissa somewhere and told them their parents were looking for them,&quot; An's mother Betty told Belgian television.</p>
<p>The four were all kidnapped or held by convicted child rapist Marc Dutroux, 39, an unemployed father of three. Two other girls he had concealed in a concrete dungeon were rescued late last week.</p>
<p>Melissa and Julie starved to death while Dutroux was serving a brief jail term for violent theft and an accomplice neglected to feed them. Dutroux killed him in retaliation, police said.</p>
<p>Dutroux is believed to have been the mastermind behind a kidnapping, child trafficking and juvenile pornography gang which included his second wife Michelle.</p>
<p>When Marchal and Lambrecks first disappeared, police delayed starting a search for them for 10 days despite their families' anguished pleas, assuming they had simply run away from home.</p>
<p>Since the scandal broke last weekend, police -- now under fierce criticism -- have sought to make up for lost time, contacting authorities in Britain, the Netherlands and France.</p>
<p>British Detective Superintendent John Bennett, who led the investigation into the &quot;House of Horrors&quot; murders in Gloucester, western England, arrived on Wednesday to offer advice.</p>
<p>Sophisticated heat-seeking and radar equipment was being used to ensure no further bodies were hidden at Dutroux's various properties around the southern city of Charleroi.</p>
<p>Detectives in Gloucester used similar machinery to locate the victims of Fred and Rosemary West, who are believed to have killed and buried at least 10 women and girls.</p>
<p>At least 15 children have vanished in Belgium in the past six years. Seven have now been found dead, six are still missing and only two have been rescued.</p>
<p>In the wake of Dutroux's arrest, Belgian and Dutch police have re-opened various dormant cases of missing children.</p>
<p>Belgian media said authorities were mulling the possibility of carrying out DNA genetic fingerprinting tests to compare tissue taken from Dutroux with tissue found on two young murder victims, including a German girl killed near the coast this summer.</p>
<p>Under Belgian law, however, the suspect would have to give his consent.</p>
