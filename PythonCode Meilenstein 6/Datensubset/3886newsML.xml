<title>PAKISTAN: Kabul plans to open northern highway.</title>
<headline>Kabul plans to open northern highway.</headline>
<dateline>ISLAMABAD 1996-08-20</dateline>

<p>Afghanistan's embattled government said on Tuesday it would open the main northern Salang highway next week to traffic as a result of peace talks with an opposition alliance controlling the area.</p>
<p>A government statement broadcast by the official Kabul Radio, monitored in Islamabad, said the Kabul-Salang highway would be open from August 26 or 27.</p>
<p>The decision was taken &quot;as a result of talks with the (opposition) Supreme Coordination Council (alliance)&quot; led by the Jumbish-i-Milli movement of powerful opposition warlord General Abdul Rashid Dostum, it said.</p>
<p>There was no immediate confirmation of the report.</p>
<p>The Salang highway, Afghanistan's main route to Central Asia, has been controlled by Dostum since he began fighting President Burhanuddin Rabbani's government in Kabul in January 1994 in alliance with Hezb-i-Islami party leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, then prime minister but rival to the president.</p>
<p>Hekmatyar rejoined the government as prime minister last June under a peace pact with Rabbani and sent an envoy to the northern town of Mazar-i-Sharif earlier this month to persuade Dostum to do the same.</p>
<p>On January 13, a Jumbish spokesman in Pakistan denied a Kabul Radio report that the two sides had agreed to a ceasefire in the north but said there was no fighting in the area these days.</p>
<p>Opening the Salang highway was one of the main objectives of Hekmatyar's envoy.</p>
