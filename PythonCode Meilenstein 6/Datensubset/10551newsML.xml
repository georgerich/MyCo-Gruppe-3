<p>England batsman John Crawley was forced to endure a frustrating delay of over three hours before resuming his quest for a maiden test century in the third test against Pakistan on Friday.</p>
<p>Heavy overnight rain and morning drizzle ruled out any play before lunch on the second day but an improvement in the weather prompted the umpires to announce a 1415 local time (1315 GMT) start in the event of no further rain.</p>
<p>Crawley, unbeaten on 94 overnight in an England total of 278 for six, was spotted strumming a guitar in the dressing-room as the Oval ground staff took centre stage.</p>
<p>There were several damp patches on the square and the outfield and it was still raining when the players took an early lunch at 1230 local time (1130 GMT).</p>
<p>When brighter weather finally arrived, the umpires announced a revised figure of 67 overs to be bowled with play extended to at least 1900 local time (1800 GMT).</p>
