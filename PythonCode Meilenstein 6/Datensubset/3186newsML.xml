<p>Terrified civilians flooded out of Grozny on Tuesday after a top Russian military official threatened to use aircraft and heavy artillery to drive separatist forces from the Chechen capital.</p>
<p>The refugees, many with little more than the clothes they wore, said Russian planes had started bombing the city, much of it already in ruins from attacks at the start of Russia's campaign to crush Chechnya's independence bid in late 1994.</p>
<p>&quot;The whole city is on its way out,&quot; said Nina Madayeva, who said 12 planes had bombed Grozny's southwestern Chernorechye district overnight. &quot;We've been in a basement for 14 or 15 days and couldn't stand it any more.&quot;</p>
<p>Konstantin Pulikovsky, Russia's acting commander in Chechnya, said his forces had begun artillery attacks on the rebels who took over most of Grozny on August 6, and would bomb the city if needed to drive them out.</p>
<p>But he denied that bombing had already started.</p>
<p>Pulikovsky's superior, Vyacheslav Tikhomirov, returned from holiday to Grozny and said he was determined to get the rebels out of the city, Interfax news agency said.</p>
<p>&quot;For that we are ready to use all means, political and military,&quot; it quoted him as saying.</p>
<p>&quot;I have so far not cancelled Konstantin Pulikovsky's ultimatum. I am currently getting back into my job, but I can say one thing: serious measures will be taken against the separatists unless they leave Grozny.&quot;</p>
<p>With the region on the brink of all-out war and President Boris Yeltsin reported to have gone on holiday, arguments broke out in Moscow over who was running policy on Chechnya.</p>
<p>Russia's influential Security Council, whose secretary, Alexander Lebed was put in charge of resolving the conflict last week by Yeltsin, cast doubt over the authenticity of the president's latest orders on the region.</p>
<p>A Security Council statement said Yeltsin did not appear to have been involved in drawing up the order to retake Grozny from the rebels, which carried a facsimile of his signature.</p>
<p>It said carrying the order out would ruin peace efforts undertaken by Lebed and wreck a ceasefire deal he agreed with the separatist leaders.</p>
<p>&quot;This would mean in fact the beginning of a large-scale military operation involving aviation and artillery, which would naturally lead to heavy losses among federal troops, massive deaths among the civilian population...and a justified burst of resentment in the country,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>The presidential press office said Yeltsin had left for Valdai, some 350 km (220 miles) northwest of Moscow. But an official in the Novgorod region where Valdai is located said they knew nothing about the visit.</p>
<p>Lebed and rebel leaders agreed last week to arrange a truce to allow peace negotiations to resume in a region racked by conflict which has cost tens of thousands of lives in 20 months.</p>
<p>Pulikovsky, who signed the ceasefire order on Saturday, accused the guerrillas of using the truce to dig in in the regional capital, much of which they seized two weeks ago.</p>
<p>&quot;I see force as the only way out of the situation in Grozny,&quot; he told Interfax news agency.</p>
<p>Rebel chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov appealed to Kremlin security chief Alexander Lebed, who has held talks with the rebels and opposed the use of aircraft, to rein in the troops.</p>
<p>Yeltsin's special envoy to Chechnya should &quot;use all of his influence to stop the approaching madness&quot;, Interfax quoted Maskhadov as saying.</p>
<p>Itar-Tass news agency said Lebed would travel to Chechnya on Wednesday -- his third visit to the region in just over a week. Tass said Lebed remained committed to a peaceful solution to the Chechen conflict.</p>
