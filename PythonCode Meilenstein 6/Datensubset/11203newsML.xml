<p>Brazilian coffee exports are continuing in line with a scheme agreed with other members of the Association of Coffee Producing Countries (ACPC), export representatives told a government official today.</p>
<p>Representatives from the Brazilian Federation of Coffee Exporters (FEBEC) and the Brazilian Association of Coffee Exporters (Abecafe) met with Mauricio Assis, head of the primary commodities department at the Industry and Commerce Ministry in the second of a series of monthly session to monitor exports.</p>
<p>&quot;We told him that we are going to be in line with the ACPC agreement...Sales are going very well,&quot; said FEBEC president Oswaldo Aranha.</p>
<p>Under the ACPC plan, Brazil can ship nine million bags in the first six months of the coffee year (July/June).</p>
<p>In July, Brazil shipped 1.12 million bags according to FEBEC statistics. In August, estimates are that shipments will be between 1.4 million and 1.5 million bags.</p>
<p>&quot;September is expected to be even larger than August. It could even be two million bags,&quot; Aranha said.</p>
<p>Exporters also raised the issue of the abolition of the 13 percent ICMS export tax currently under discussion in Congress and which, if approved, would take effect at the earliest from January 1 next year.</p>
<p>&quot;We are concerned this may affect export performance as producers could hold back in anticipation,&quot; Aranha said.</p>
