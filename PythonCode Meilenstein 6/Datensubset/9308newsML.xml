<p>Brazil's monetary base expanded 1.4 percent in July, according to daily averages, or 11.5 percent calculating month on month, the central bank said.  </p>
<p>The central bank said net public sector debt in June grew to an estimated 241.457 billion reais, equivalent to 33.9 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), versus 233.32 billion reais or 33.2 percent of GDP in May.</p>
<p>Net internal debt was 210.722 billion reais in June, or 29.6 percent of GDP, against 202.202 billion reais or 28.8 percent of GDP in May.</p>
<p>Net external debt in June was 30.735 billion reais, or 4.3 percent of GDP, slightly down from 31.118 billion reais or 4.4 percent of GDP in May, the bank said.  </p>
<p>The central bank said the increase was mainly due to 4.6 billion reais in PROER credits and rediscount lines.</p>
<p>PROER credit lines are designed to finance bank mergers and acquisitions.</p>
<p>The bank said the public sector borrowing requirements, in primary terms, represented a deficit of 0.13 percent of GDP in the January-to-June period, compared with a surplus of 0.58 percent in the January-to-May period.</p>
<p>The operational public sector deficit was 3.57 percent of GDP in the first half, it said.</p>
<p>The bank said the monetary base was 17.699 billion reais in July. That compared with a monetary base target in the third quarter of between 16.6 billion and 19.5 billion reais.</p>
