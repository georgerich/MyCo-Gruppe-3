<title>RUSSIA: Silence welcome in Grozny, worrying in Moscow.</title>
<headline>Silence welcome in Grozny, worrying in Moscow.</headline>

<p>An imperfect silence settled over Grozny on Friday. Only sporadic shooting disturbed a ceasefire that brought relief to the beleaguered Chechen capital after two weeks of some of the worst fighting the region has seen.</p>
<p>But hope of a lasting peace was dulled by a more ominous silence in Moscow, where the Kremlin refused to comment after Boris Yeltsin's envoy, Alexander Lebed, struck the ambitious truce deal with Chechnya's separatist rebels and vowed to return on Saturday to seal a political settlement.</p>
<p>More, the president did not even seem ready to meet the man who, after less than a fortnight in charge, claimed to have put an end to the 20-month war which has ruined countless careers and once seemed likely to cost Yeltsin July's election.</p>
<p>Just hours before Thursday's agreement in Chechnya, Yeltsin had even gone on television for the first time in two weeks to chide Lebed for his slow progress, prompting speculation he was either about to dump Lebed or was simply out of touch.</p>
<p>The impression, not for the first time, is that Russian policy is adrift in Chechnya, where tens of thousands have died have since Yeltsin sent in troops in December 1994.</p>
<p>Lebed flew back to Moscow from Chechnya early on Friday, saying he planned to brief Yeltsin on the truce and on the political pact planned for Saturday on relations with Chechnya.</p>
<p>But the presidential press office denied the meeting. A Kremlin source later told Interfax news agency the two might meet, but not until next week -- only after a political accord.</p>
<p>Yet there was no indication what political deal Lebed might be proposing and even less sign that he could sell it to Moscow.</p>
<p>Lebed, an ex-general who owes his position to coming third in the first round of the presidential election in June, has won praise from the separatists for his conciliatory approach.</p>
<p>He has said Chechen independence is not taboo for him. But it has always been the sticking point for Moscow.</p>
<p>Despite the supposedly sweeping, though never publicly spelled out, powers given to Lebed by Yeltsin to end the crisis, there has been no indication that the Kremlin is ready to let him offer secession as an option -- least of all in the wake of the Russian army's humiliating loss of Grozny on August 6.</p>
<p>That leaves nothing but theories about what is going on.</p>
<p>Lebed himself says a &quot;party of war&quot; in Moscow is trying to sabotage his peace talks, possibly faking Yeltsin's orders while the president is indisposed. Aides deny the president is ill but he still looked stiff and slow on television on Thursday.</p>
<p>Lebed reckoned this week's threat by the Russian army to bomb Grozny flat was a result of such scheming. For now, the Russian army generals seem to be going along with Lebed's plan to pull troops out of some districts in Chechnya.</p>
<p>One variation on the simple power struggle theory is that Yeltsin still runs policy and is playing his various underlings off against each other to see which one is most successful.</p>
<p>His refusal to meet Lebed may just be the classic tactic of retiring from the scene until it is clear who is doing best.</p>
<p>If Lebed succeeds in saving peace with honour for Moscow, Yeltsin may welcome him back as a hero.</p>
<p>If the general fails, his short political career may be over.</p>
<p>Some cynics argue that the whole scenario of Lebed struggling alone against Kremlin intrigue and bellicose generals is a ploy to win him the rebels' confidence.</p>
<p>Sergei Baburin, the leftist deputy parliamentary speaker told Reuters on Friday the week's chaos was just Lebed's &quot;theatre&quot;, orchestrated to advance his own political career.</p>
