<p>One person died and at least 10 were injured on Thursday when a tanker carrying chemicals exploded near this small village on the main highway to the central city of Puebla 50 miles (80 km) from Mexico City, witnesses and officials said.</p>
<p>Firemen and army and Red Cross rescue units rushed to the area to evacuate the injured and extinguish the burning truck, which was carrying at least 8,000 gallons (30,000 litres) of liquid propylene when it exploded .</p>
<p>The driver of the truck was burned to death, Puebla state Civil Protection chief Guillermo Melgarejo told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;There are 10 people in hospital with burns, of whom a young boy is in the most serious condition,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The blast appeared to have been caused when one of two tanks of propylene being hauled by the truck came loose, causing the driver to lose control of his vehicle and crash as he passed near the village.</p>
