<p>Aerospace and transportation equipment maker Bombardier Inc. said on Tuesday that it expected to announce in its fiscal third quarter 30 to 35 more firm orders for its Canadair Regional Jet.</p>
<p>&quot;What we expect is that by the end of the next quarter we are going to fill our order backlog for next year. For that we require a good number of orders between now and the end of October. I would say between 30 and 35 would be very satisfying,&quot; Bombardier spokesman Michel Lord said.</p>
<p>That would almost double the current order backlog of 40 for the 50-seat jet. Montreal-based Bombardier is producing the plane at a rate of five each month.</p>
<p>Lord was confirming a forecast made by Chief Executive Laurent Beaudoin in a telephone conference call with analysts late Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p>In the conference call, Beaudoin said that he expected Bombardier to announce in the third quarter ended Oct. 31 firm orders for the Regional Jet that would fill production output to Jan. 31, 1998.</p>
<p>Lord said most of the new orders are likely to come from North American airlines.</p>
<p>&quot;I would say that we are talking most about North America at this time, where the market is quite active and you have large regional airlines that can order a sizeable amount of aircraft in one order,&quot; Lord said.</p>
<p>Margaret Cornish-Kehoe, analyst at ScotiaMcLeod Inc., said Beaudoin's forecast was well received as it was the first time in several months that Bombardier made a specific forecast on boosting its firm order book for the Regional Jet.</p>
<p>&quot;I am very happy. There is no question this is very positive,&quot; Cornish-Kehoe said.</p>
<p>Some analysts had been worried in recent weeks that Bombardier had not updated its order backlog for the Regional Jet. But in heavy trading last week and on Monday and Tuesday, Bombardier's Class B shares recovered much of the ground lost earlier on those concerns.</p>
<p>On the Toronto Stock Exchange, Bombardier's Class B shares closed trading on Tuesday at C$19.15, ($13.98) up 10 Canadian cents on a volume of 1.6 million shares.</p>
<p>The Regional Jet has been the star performer at Bombardier over the last two years, gaining wider acceptance with North American and European carriers.</p>
<p>In September, Bombardier is scheduled to introduce its Global Express business jet, which is seen as a competitor to Gulfstream Aerospace Corp.'s new Gulfstream V jet.</p>
<p>Bombardier's forecast for Regional Jet orders came after it reported on Tuesday a 29 percent jump in its second quarter earnings, a profit increase that Cornish said was widely expected.</p>
<p>Bombardier's net income in the second quarter ended July 31 was C$90.3 million ($66 million), or 25 cents Canadian (18 cents) a share, compared with C$69.5 million ($51 million) or C20 cents (15 cents) a share in the year earlier period. Revenues were C$1.9 billion ($1.4 billion), compared with C$1.5 billion ($1.1 billion) a year earlier.</p>
<p>Bombardier manufactures airplanes, rail transportation equipment and consumer motorized products such as snow mobiles and water pleasure craft.</p>
