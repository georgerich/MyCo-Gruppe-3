<p>NEW YORK, Aug 21 - The dollar eased against the mark Wednesday after new German economic data dimmed hopes for a cut in German interest rates, but the U.S. currency climbed against the yen as a Japanese finance company's bankruptcy hinted at continued low interest rates in Japan.</p>
<p>Traders had looked to a business sentiment survey for signs that German monetary officials meeting on Thursday would need to reduce interest rates further in order to bolster Germany's sluggish economy.</p>
<p>However, the Ifo Institute for Economic Research reported that business sentiment improved sharply in western Germany to a reading of 94.1 in July from 90.4 in June, while the eastern Germany rating rose to 102.9 in July from 101.4 in June. The hefty increase in western Germany far outstripped economists' forecast of a modest rise to 91 in July.</p>
<p>&quot;The Ifo survey cast last minute doubt on the probability of a rate cut,&quot; said Brian McCarthy, a market analyst at Ruesch International.</p>
<p>Yet, he said, &quot;if they do cut, the dollar should recover.&quot;</p>
<p>A reduction of short-term interest rates in Germany would likely boost the dollar by making bank deposits denominated in the U.S. currency more attractive.</p>
<p>In late New York trading, the dollar settled at 1.4825 marks, down from 1.4883 on Tuesday. The dollar rose to 108.45 yen from 108.35 yen.</p>
<p>Further signs that a recovering German economy might not need stimulation from lower interest rates emerged in two other reports released Tuesday. West German industrial orders were revised higher in July and production of automobiles, trucks and vans in Germany picked up from January to July, compared with the same period a year ago.</p>
<p>The strong economic data particularly surprised traders because it came one day after a report on the broadest measure of the German money supply, M3, which had raised hopes for an interest rate cut by pointing to mild inflation.</p>
<p>&quot;You think, with M3, now you're going to get the cut, and all of a sudden the next day, other financial news comes out saying maybe they won't cut,&quot; said Robert Gilmartin, a vice president of foreign exchange at First Union National Bank. &quot;But the proof will be in the pudding tomorrow morning.&quot;</p>
<p>Both the dollar and the mark gained against the yen as prospects for continued low interest rates in Japan improved after consumer finance firm Minami Kyushu Credit Co. Ltd said it filed for bankruptcy with debts of 108 billion yen.</p>
<p>The Bank of Japan has kept official interest rates at rock-bottom levels to boost economic growth and help restore Japan's debt ladden financial sector.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think they're nearly ready to raise rates yet, quite frankly, and certainly not with another financial institution going belly up,&quot; said Ben Strauss, an assistant vice president at Bank Julius Baer and Co. &quot;It's another reason to sell yen.&quot;</p>
<p>Questions about the health of Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin helped to bolster the Swiss franc, which is traditionally considered a safe haven currency. While the mark is also viewed as a haven, close economic ties between Germany and Russia lessen the appeal of the mark.</p>
<p>The dollar fell to 1.2005 Swiss francs from 1.2070 francs on Tuesday. The British pound rose to $1.5506 from $1.5480, and the dollar climbed to Canadian $1.3740 from C$1.3733.</p>
