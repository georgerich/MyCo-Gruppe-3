<title>AUSTRALIA: RTRS-Australian Commodities Roundup - Aug 23.</title>
<headline>RTRS-Australian Commodities Roundup - Aug 23.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1996-08-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>A reduction in a key German interest rate by the Bundesbank did little to move commodity prices on Thursday but it could help revive them in the third quarter, econmomists said.</p>
<p>The Commodities Research Bureau Index fell 0.04 points to 249.80 in Chicago.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold, the most closely related of the commodity markets, shrugged off the move in a very quiet trading day and the other markets were mainly involved in squaring their books ahead of a three-day holiday weekend in Britain and Hong Kong.</p>
<p>But a New York based economist noted the more accommodating monetary policy in Europe could stimulate industry and therefore demand for metals.</p>
<p>Others also noted that the U.S. Federal Reserve (central bank) was likely to leave rates unchanged until after the presidential electionin November having left them unchanged after a policy committee meeting this week</p>
<p>Gold closed a little easier at $386.95 per ounce after blipping a little higher midafternoon when the investment funds took a brief punt at the silver market.</p>
<p>Silver had rallied briskly in New York on Monday also turned back in its latest move when speculators saw a profit-taking opportunity at $5.25 an ounce -- also its peak on Monday.</p>
<p>It closed at $5.23, up three cents from Wednesday.</p>
<p>GRAINS</p>
<p>Agricultural commodities were mixed with the grains taking direction from generally lower prices on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) futures markets.</p>
<p>CBOT soybean futures were mixed at midsession on bearish input from a crop tour of Illinois, a key U.S. soy producing state, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Results from the crop tour and the weather are good,&quot; a trader said referring to the rationale behind the slide in soybean futures.</p>
<p>Overall good crop weather in the U.S. Midwest also pressured the market.</p>
<p>At 1128 CDT, soybeans were 3-3/4 cents per bushel lower to 2-3/4 higher, with September up 2-3/4 at $8.03.</p>
<p>Wheat futures were lower on improving weather prospects and slow exports of U.S. wheat. &quot;The demand is just not there,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>Wheat was 1/2 to two cents per bushel lower, with September down 1-1/2 at $4.49-1/2.</p>
<p>OIL</p>
<p>World oil prices rallied sharply on Thursday as strong demand for diesel and heating oil combined with reduced output from European and Asian refineries.</p>
<p>October futures for Brent Blend crude, used as a benchmark for most of the world market, jumped by 52 cents on the day to close at $20.73 per barrel, continuing a rally that has added around $2 to the cost of a barrel over the past four weeks.</p>
<p>&quot;It's being driven by refined products strength and fundamental demand,&quot; said Alastair Harris of broking house MeesPierson Derivatives in London.  </p>
