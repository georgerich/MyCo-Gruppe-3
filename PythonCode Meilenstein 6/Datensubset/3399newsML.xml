<p>Mexico's same-day peso closed flat on Tuesday, giving up earlier gains when local banks dumped pesos upon deciding that the Cetes auction today would be too pricey, dealers said.</p>
<p>The same-day peso lost 0.05 of a centavo to 7.4725/7.4775 after having gained nearly a centavo in early trade.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the 48- and 24-hour contracts also were flat. The 48-hour or spot peso was unchanged at 7.4690/7.4790 and the 24-hour peso 0.1 of a centavo better at 7.4650/7.4750.</p>
<p>The peso had been in demand from foreigners buying stocks but then was pressured by the banks, dealers said.  </p>
<p>&quot;Some banks came in right before closing to offer pesos because people are starting to talk about a fall of 300 basis points in the (28-day) primary Cetes auction,&quot; one trader said. &quot;They need to square positions.&quot;</p>
<p>The 28-day Cetes rate was expected to fall around 200 basis points at today's auction, but later outlooks for a steeper drop of up to 300 basis points were making some traders leery.</p>
<p>One-month paper was issued at 26.63 percent in last week's primary auction. If rates dip too much lower, banks may stand back altogether from the auction as yields are not appealing enough, dealers said.</p>
