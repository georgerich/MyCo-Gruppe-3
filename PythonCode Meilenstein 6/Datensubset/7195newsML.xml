<p>Australian wildlife officials made repeated attempts on Wednesday to prevent up to 300 long-finned pilot whales from beaching themselves on a remote part of Australia's west coast.</p>
<p>About 200 of the whales were discovered on a beach by residents of Dunsborough, 200 km (124 miles) south of Perth, late on Tuesday night, officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;The animals were thrashing around and the water was red with blood. It was rather a horrible sight,&quot; Western Australia state wildlife official Charlie Broadbent told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;They were definitely in distress. They were thrashing around and throwing themselves on the rocks, causing cuts and bruises, which led to extensive bleeding,&quot; Broadbent said.</p>
<p>Wildlife services and up to 500 volunteers worked overnight after a local radio station appealed for help to rescue the stranded mammals, which are a bit bigger in size than humans.</p>
<p>Fourteen of the whales died on the beach but the remainder were successfully moved into deeper water.</p>
<p>About 50 whales later returned to the beach and again had to be led out to sea. Another large part of the pod was later seen near the shoreline several kilometres east of Dunsborough.</p>
<p>Broadbent said the position of the pod was being monitored because there were fears all 300-odd whales might attempt to beach themselves. &quot;We are trying to guide them into deeper water, where they are more comfortable,&quot; he said.</p>
