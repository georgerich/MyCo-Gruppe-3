<p>China is to launch a campaign to clean up a polluted river that is threatening residents' health and poisoning crops, the China Daily said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Sewage treatment plants would be built along the northeastern Liao river valley and factories would be ordered to cut pollution or close down under the campaign to clean up the river by 2005, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>&quot;The people in this valley, half of them engaged in agriculture, forestry, fishery and animal husbandry, have had their health affected (by pollution),&quot; it quoted Song Jian, chairman of the National Environmental Protection Committee, as saying.</p>
<p>The river valley, which runs through northeastern China and is home to around 30 million people, was so polluted that some crops in the area contained poisonous substances, the newspaper said but gave no details.</p>
<p>Pollution had aggravated water shortages along the river, which flows through the industrial provinces of Liaoning, Jilin and Hebei from Inner Mongolia, it said.</p>
<p>Industrial firms that discharged about one billion tonnes of waste water each year would be required to treat their waste water within one to three years or face being shut down, Song said.</p>
<p>Dyeing mills, small paper mills and other high-pollution factories should also be closed, he said.</p>
<p>Liaoning province on the river's lower reaches was responsible for 90 percent of its pollution, but areas inland would be expected to help with the clean-up, he said.</p>
<p>Pollutants from the river had badly affected sea water in Liaodong Bay, damaging ocean resources and aquatic husbandry, the China Daily said.</p>
<p>Official statistics show that nine billion tonnes of untreated waste water a year flowed into the seas around China, carrying 1.46 million tonnes of pollutants including organic compounds and petroleum.</p>
