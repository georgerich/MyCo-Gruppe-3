<p>Israel's outgoing peace negotiator with Syria described current tensions between the two countries as a storm in a teacup, saying on Thursday it appeared Damascus wanted to talk rather than fight.</p>
<p>But Syria signalled it was in no mood to resume negotiations deadlocked over the Golan Heights unless Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dropped his opposition to exchanging occupied land for peace.</p>
<p>Itamar Rabinovich, who as Israel's ambassador to Washington held talks with Syria, told Israel Radio: &quot;It appears to me the Syrian priority is still to negotiate.</p>
<p>&quot;The Syrians are confused, they are definitely tense, but the general assessment here in Washington is that this is essentially a storm in a teacup,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Syria has accused Israel of launching a hysterical campaign against it after Israeli television reported Damascus had recently test fired a missile able to hit cities in the Jewish state. It said its arms purchases were for defensive purposes.</p>
<p>Israel on Wednesday sent Syria a message, via Washington, saying it was committed to peace and wanted to open negotiations without preconditions. But it slammed Damascus for creating what it called a dangerous atmosphere.</p>
<p>Turning down the offer on Thursday, Syria's official newspaper Tishreen said talks could be based only on an Israeli withdrawal from the strategic Golan.</p>
<p>&quot;Syria will never negotiate for the sake of negotiations and will not be dragged into the trap of talks 'with no preconditions' which simply means holding talks that are not based on any principle and allowing Netanyahu to say the Golan is an Israeli land,&quot; Tishreen said.</p>
<p>Israeli-Syrian peace talks have been deadlocked since 1991 despite the previous government's willingness to make Golan concessions. Peace talks between the two sides were last held in February.</p>
<p>Chief negotiator Rabinovich is winding up his term as ambassador. He will be replaced by Eliahu Ben-Elissar, a former Israeli envoy to Egypt and right-wing Likud party politician.</p>
<p>Israel's Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper reported the tensions with Damascus arose largely from recent &quot;irregular&quot; movement of several Syrian army units from their usual positions in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley to Syria itself.</p>
<p>Israel interpreted the move as Syria's response to a public warning by Netanyahu of a strong Israeli military response to attacks by Lebanese Hizbollah guerrillas against Israeli occupation forces in south Lebanon, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>Sudden troop movements sound alarm bells in Israel, which was caught off-guard by surprise Syrian and Egyptian attacks that started the 1973 Middle East war.</p>
<p>A security source said &quot;nothing out of the ordinary&quot; had happened in the north since the Syrian troop movements at the beginning of the week.</p>
<p>Israel's Channel Two television said Damascus had sent a &quot;calming signal&quot; to Israel. It gave no source for the report. Netanyahu and Levy's spokesmen said they could not confirm it.</p>
<p>The television also said that Netanyahu had sent messages to reassure Syria via Cairo, the United States and Moscow.</p>
