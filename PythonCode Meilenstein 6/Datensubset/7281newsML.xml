<p>The liquidation committee for the defunct Stock Market Stabilisation Fund said on Wednesday it would return 922.2 billion won in cash to its investors on September 2-9.</p>
<p>A committee official said the money was a portion of the 1.37 trillion won the fund was holding in cash and bonds.</p>
<p>The rest would be repaid by next February, he said.</p>
<p>But the fund's stock holdings, valued at 4.2 trillion won, would be repaid over five years after a two-year grace period.</p>
<p>The fund was set up on May 7, 1990 mainly by domestic securities houses and was used by the government to intervene in the stock market. It was liquidated in May this year after criticism that intervention impeded the efficient development of the bourse.</p>
