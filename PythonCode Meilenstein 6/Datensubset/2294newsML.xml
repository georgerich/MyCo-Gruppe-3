<p>Shoppers are loading up this year on perennial back-to-school favourites such as jeans, shirts and sneakers, with parents spending an average of 12 percent more for clothing and other supplies.</p>
<p>&quot;It's sort of funny because it really hasn't changed a lot from years ago, with jeans, shirts and pants and things like that being the basics of what people are looking for,&quot; said Andrea Kent, director of the Retail Marketing Group for American Express Travel Related Services Inc.</p>
<p>Overall, back-to-school spending will rise a projected 12 percent to an average of $363 per child, American Express said in its second annual survey of 1,000 shoppers.</p>
<p>The spending increase was caused by an emphasis on brand-name goods that typically cost more, lower retailer inventories which reduce the amount of discounted, sale merchandise, and higher consumer confidence, American Express said.</p>
<p>It added that 18 percent of parents say they planned to spend $500 or more per child on back-to-school items such as clothing, supplies, textbooks and electronics.</p>
<p>Across the board, clothing accounts for the highest portion of the back-to-school budget. The percentage is highest for elementary students, at 66 percent of the budget, and high school students, at 63 percent. For college students, clothing accounts for 33 percent of the budget, followed closely behind by textbooks at 25 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;College students have a much greater demand for other items... Textbooks is a very high expense for college students, accounting for 25 percent of their back-to-school budget,&quot; Kent said.</p>
<p>Curiously, the American Express survey found that college boys are dramatically more style-conscious than college girls, a finding that was contrary to last year's results.</p>
<p>Among the retailers, department stores are battling speciality shops for back-to-school sales, with discount department stores getting a large portion of the sales.</p>
<p>Back-to-school -- the second largest selling season for retailers -- has taken on even more importance since the all-important holiday season between Thanksgiving and Christmas is five days shorter this year.</p>
<p>&quot;The department stores are back with a bang... They are fighting for the purse, hearts and minds of the mall-brats, and they are flexing their fashion muscles,&quot; said Alan Millstein, president of Fashion Network Inc., a New York-based retail consultant.</p>
<p>The American Express survey showed discount department stores are capturing 35 percent of sales, followed by malls at 29 percent and department stores at 26 percent. Other retail locations, such as factory outlets and office supply stores, accounted for 10 percent.</p>
<p>The decision of where to shop is mostly left up to parents, the survey revealed, while the children had the most influence over what to buy.</p>
<p>&quot;If you let your kids pick out what ... to buy, they are more likely to want to wear it,&quot; Kent said. &quot;Back when I was a kid, my mom took me shopping and she picked out what she liked for me.&quot;</p>
<p>What kids are picking out are jeans, with the Levi Strauss &amp; Co.'s Levi brand being the most popular, Kent added.</p>
<p>Jeans are also an important draw for department stores trying to lure high school and college students, with offerings that include designer jeans from Tommy Hilfiger, Ralph Lauren Polo and Calvin Klein.</p>
<p>Millstein added that low-slung, hip-hugging jeans with bell bottoms are big sellers.</p>
<p>&quot;Anything that has a ... retro look of the peace march is back in fashion and selling,&quot; Millstein said.</p>
<p>Among the hot-selling items at Target, the discount department store chain owned by Dayton Hudson Corp., are T-shirts and accessories, such as clay rings and necklaces, that are reminiscent of the 1970s, according to Dayton Hudson spokeswoman Susan Eich.</p>
<p>Other popular items include jumper's for girls, backpacks, clogs and &quot;anything with zippers,&quot; Eich added.</p>
