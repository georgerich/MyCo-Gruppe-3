<p>Australian Treasurer Peter Costello said he would like to see the budget near balance in the fiscal year to June 1998, despite Tuesday's budget forecast for a small deficit.</p>
<p>Asked how he would like to report on the Australian economy in a year's time, he said: &quot;I would like to be able to say that in the forthcoming year we'll go close to balance, although on current projections it would be a deficit, it'd be a very small deficit.&quot;  </p>
<p>In Tuesday's budget the underlying deficit, which excludes asset sales and other one off items, was forecast to fall to A$5.65 billion in 1996/97 from A$10.3 billion in 1995/96 and then to A$1.5 billion in June 1998. The budget forecast an underlying surplus of A$1.0 billion by June 1999.</p>
<p>On winning office in March, Costello had originally committed the Liberal National government to restoring underlying balance by the end of the 1997/98 fiscal year, but this was pushed out to 1998/99 when figures released last month showed the underlying deficit for 1995/96 was over A$1.0 billion higher than earlier thought. -- Canberra Bureau 61-6 273 2730</p>
