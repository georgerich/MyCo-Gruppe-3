<title>ARGENTINA: Argentine unions mulling only 24-hour strike.</title>

<p>Argentina's largest labor federation CGT is now considering a 24-hour strike without demonstrations rather than the 36-hour walkout with worker mobilization it was contemplating, a CGT spokesman said.</p>
<p>Carlos West Ocampo told the daily Clarin that the change was due to security reasons after a union assembly last Tuesday to take a strike vote was aborted by a gunfight between rival factions that left several workers wounded.</p>
<p>The CGT meeting to vote on the strike against the government's belt-tightening measures has been rescheduled for Friday.  </p>
<p>&quot;We don't want to allow the anonymous trouble-makers a chance to act,&quot; West Ocampo said.</p>
<p>The Tuesday shootout broke out after supporters of the radical union splinter group MTA tried to force their way into the sports center where the labor summit was underway. Seven union members were hit, two of them suffering serious chest wounds.</p>
<p>Before Tuesday's labor summit, union leaders had said they were planning a 36-hour strike with a demonstration in the Plaza de Mayo to oppose the latest set of austerity measures announced by new Economy Minister Roque Fernandez.  </p>
<p>Three weeks ago unions held a day-long general strike against belt-tightening measures by then-Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo taxing widely-used food vouchers and scrapping family allowance for workers making more than $1,000 a month.</p>
<p>Fernandez took over and came up with his own austerity regime, which includes Cavallo's measures. Fernandez's measures include a generalization of value added tax and a hike in gasoline levies.</p>
<p>The new set of measures have drawn fresh fire from unions. Administration officials expect they will improve revenue by around $4.0 billion next year. Congress is expected to approve the package in October.</p>
