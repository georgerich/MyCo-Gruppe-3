<title>NETHERLANDS: Dutch closing debt market report.</title>
<headline>Dutch closing debt market report.</headline>

<p>Dutch bonds finished lower for the second successive day but off their lows after July money supply data kept alive hopes of a cut in Germany's repo rate.</p>
<p>Dealers said trading action, dominated by interbank players, trailed off after a morning flurry when Germany announced annual M3 growth slowed to 8.6 percent from 9.6 percent in June.</p>
<p>They said the market was awaiting tonight's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which is not expected to change U.S. interest rates, and Thursday's Bundesbank meeting.</p>
<p>&quot;Nobody's taking a position. They were position-squaring. There's still no customers involved,&quot; said one broker.  </p>
<p>The new Dutch 5.75 percent September 2002 tap issue closed at 110.19/27, below today's opening sale price of 100.30, as the Finance Ministry announced it had raised 2.3 billion guilders since sales began on Monday at a price of 100.60.</p>
<p>Analysts believe the ministry aims to raise up to 10 billion guilders through this issue but one dealer said it may have to await market developments this week to achieve its target.</p>
<p>Dealers also reported demand through the day for Dutch state loans maturing between 2000 and 2004, but they saw little change in the shape of the yield curve or the spread to bunds.</p>
