<headline>S&amp;P ups Merita Bank unsecured l-term to BBB plus.</headline>

<p>Standard &amp; Poor's said on Wednesday it raised its senior unsecured long-term debt and counterparty ratings of Merita Bank Ltd. to BBB plus from BBB.</p>
<p>S&amp;P said in a statement it also raised the bank's dated subordinated debt rating to BBB from BBB minus, and the junior subordinated debt rating to BBB minus from BB.</p>
<p>It affirmed the A2 short-term debt and counterparty ratings and said the outlook for the long-term debt ratings was stable.  </p>
<p>&quot;The rating action reflects the dominant position that Merita holds in the Finnish banking industry, its strong funding, and improving asset quality,&quot; S&amp;P said.</p>
<p>Although the ratings were now based on the bank's own merits, S&amp;P said it acknowledged the benefits Merita received from the Finnish government's ongoing support package for the banking system.</p>
<p>Merita was formed in 1995 through a merger between Union Bank of Finland (UBF) and Kansallis-Osake-Pankki (KOP), which at the time, were Finland's two largest banks. Merita now holds some 50 percent of lending and deposit markets in the country.</p>
<p>&quot;While Merita should continue to benefit from the economies of scale that the merger has created, these benefits are somewhat offset by a very competitive operating environment that is placing downward pressure on margins, and thereby, suppressing the bank's ability to strengthen its profitability and capitalisation,&quot; the statement added.</p>
<p>It said management's ability to diversify the bank's income streams, while aggressively reducing a high cost base, would be an important factor in improving the financial strength of Merita in the future.</p>
<p>An improving domestic economy, which has brought interest rates down to historically low levels, has been the main driving force in reducing Merita's credit losses and nonperforming loans, the statement said.</p>
<p>However, as Merita's lending profile was strongly focused on the Finnish market, it said the bank would remain vulnerable to economic downturns, and S&amp;P continued to have concerns regarding asset concentration in the domestic economy.</p>
