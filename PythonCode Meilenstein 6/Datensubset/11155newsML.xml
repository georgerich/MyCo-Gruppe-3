<headline>Chilean shares end firm, eyes on economic data.</headline>

<p>Chilean blue chips closed higher with the opening depending on a welter of economic figures to be released by the Central Bank on Friday.</p>
<p>Investors hope the data will be more evidence the economy is slowing, which could lead to a cut in interest rates.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is focusing on what will happen tomorrow with the Imacec (economic activity) figure,&quot; said one trader. &quot;Investors believe it will reflect the depth of the credit-tightening.&quot;</p>
<p>The selective IPSA index ended up 0.14 percent at 98.36 points. The IGPA index firmed 0.08 percent to 5,388.98 points.  </p>
<p>Volume remained light at 11 billion pesos.</p>
<p>On Friday, the bank will publish its monthly report including July trade figures and the Imacec index recording economic activity in June.</p>
<p>Analysts expect the Imacec index to show economic activity in June slowed to five percent from 5.6 percent in May.</p>
<p>Investors are hoping the slowdown in the economy may persuade the Central Bank to reduce interest rates before the year-end, said traders.  </p>
<p>High local interest rates have held a grip on the bolsa for months with investors switching investments to fixed income paper, they said.</p>
<p>Risers included foresrt firm Masisa, up 0.99 percent at 205 pesos, steel-maker Cap, up 0.77 percent at 1,315 pesos and power utility Chilquinta which firmed 0.69 percent to 2,150 pesos.</p>
<p>Losers included drug firm LanChile, down 1.82 percent at 324 pesos, bottler Andina, down 0.44 percent at 2,260 pesos and glass-maker Cristales which shed 0.33 percent to 2,990 pesos.</p>
