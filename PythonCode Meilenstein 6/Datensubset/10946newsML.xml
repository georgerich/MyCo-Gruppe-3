<p>An unprecedented strike by Zimbabwean civil servants further disrupted key social services on Friday, forcing one hard-pressed psychiatric hospital to turn some mental patients over to their families.</p>
<p>Officials at Ingutsheni pyschiatric hospital, the country's largest, told reporters they had sent home 55 of 600 patients, and more might go, after they became hypersensitive to the arrival of stand-in staff struggling to cope with the crisis.</p>
<p>&quot;The situation is explosive. The patients have become hypersensitive to the change of surroundings caused by the strike and this has made them aggressive and even violent,&quot; said one official at the hospital in the southwestern city of Bulawayo.</p>
<p>State nurses, junior doctors, mortuary attendants, magistrates and prosecutors are among thousands of public servants who defied a government threat to sack them if they persisted with a strike that began on Monday.</p>
<p>Union officials estimate 70 to 80 percent the country's 180,000 civil servants are on strike.</p>
<p>The strikers, emboldened by strong public support, vowed they would remain on the streets until their demands for wage rises of between 30 and 60 percent were met.</p>
<p>The strike is a rare challenge to President Robert Mugabe and his dominant ruling ZANU-PF party, both in power since 1980.</p>
<p>Many strikers spent Friday singing and beating drums in a central Harare park, denouncing alleged government insensitivity and angered by reports that Mugabe was on honeymoon in Cape Town after wedding his former presidential secretary Grace Marufu at a lavish ceremony last weekend.</p>
<p>Some senior officials and MPs have broken ranks with the government to support the workers. Others have insisted that the government could not afford to back down.</p>
<p>MPs from the ruling ZANU-PF party who usually rally behind government positions called late on Thursday for the government to meet the workers' demands, but some cabinet ministers said there was no room to back down to &quot;mob rule&quot;.</p>
<p>Civic organisations, opposition parties and private-sector unions have weighed in with statements of solidarity, denouncing the government for recently awarding civil servants salary increases of only up to eight percent.</p>
<p>The Public Service Association (PSA) union rejects the offer as &quot;an unacceptable insult&quot; and says a majority of the southern African state's civil servants deserve more.</p>
<p>On average, civil servants earn Z$1,000 (U.S.$99) a month and PSA union leaders justify their 60 percent pay rise demand on grounds that salaries in the public service have fallen far below the cost of living over the years.</p>
<p>Annual inflation was 22.0 percent last month and averaged the same over the past two years.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no question of us going back to work before the government addresses our grievances. We are not going back and we will not respond to any threats to dismiss us,&quot; Frank Chamunorwa, vice-president of the PSA, told state radio.</p>
<p>His comments followed a statement by Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare Minister Florence Chitauro that she had told officials to sack those who did not report for work on Friday.</p>
<p>Chitauro told PSA executives at exploratory talks on Thursday that her government would consider their grievances seriously only when their followers returned to work.</p>
