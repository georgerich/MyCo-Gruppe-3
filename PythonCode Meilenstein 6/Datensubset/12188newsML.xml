<p>Australian Treasurer Peter Costello said he did not expect the opposition Labor Party to block two key revenue measures from his Tuesday Budget.</p>
<p>&quot;I think they will find it very hard, for example, to defeat the surcharge for high-income earners who don't take out private health insurance,&quot; Costello told a charted accountants briefing by video link.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that they will probably not oppose the superannuation surcharge. I think that they would find it very hard to explain to low income earners any opposition to that,&quot; Costello said.  </p>
<p>Costello's budget sought to make A$3.9 billion in savings in the year to June 1997 and A$7.2 billion in 1997/98.</p>
<p>Most of the measures are spending cuts, which require no parliamentary approval.</p>
<p>But revenue measures, such as those mentioned by Costello, must be passed by the upper house of parliament, the Senate, which the Liberal-National government does not control.</p>
<p>But the Labor opposition's failure to vote against any government bill will ensure its passage.  </p>
<p>Costello's budget included a move to raise the Medicare levy by one percent for high income earners who do not have private health insurance.</p>
<p>The move is expected to generate A$60 million of revenue in 1998/99 and A$75 million the following year.</p>
<p>The superannuation surcharge is an extra 15 percent on the contributions of high income earners, a measure which is forecast to raise an extra A$480 million in 1997/98, A$470 million in 1998/99 and A$530 million in 1999/2000.</p>
