<p>A delegate of the United Nations refugee agency said on Friday an agreement between the Zairean and Rwandan prime ministers did not set a time limit for the return of 1.1 million Rwandan Hutu refugees from Zaire.</p>
<p>Hubert Edongo Menye, UNHCR regional delegate for Central Africa, said he would meet Interior Minister Gerard Kamanda wa Kamanda on Saturday to discuss Thursday's agreement to send the refugees home.</p>
<p>&quot;This repatriation is a large scale operation, both costly and dangerous, which must take account of the dignity and safety of the refugees,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said a joint communique issued after the prime ministers' Kigali meeting had talked about the &quot;progressive closure&quot; of refugee camps in eastern Zaire, an operation which he said would need the support of the international community.</p>
<p>He said the communique had set no time limit, but added: &quot;If the conditions are met, the refugees can be repatriated.&quot;</p>
<p>Emmanuel Ndahiro, senior aide to Rwandan Vice-President Major-General Paul Kagame, told Reuters in Nairobi by telephone from Kigali that Rwanda sought an orderly, well-organised return.</p>
<p>He dismissed as &quot;pure propaganda&quot; charges by a Rwandan Hutu lobby group that Zaire and Rwanda planned to start a &quot;forced and inhuman&quot; repatriation of the refugees within the next few days.</p>
<p>&quot;Nobody (in Rwanda) is advocating an abrupt return of the refugees. The return should be orderly, decent and well-organised because not even powerful America can afford to take in one million people at once,&quot; Ndahiro said.</p>
<p>The 1.1 million mainly Hutu refugees in Zaire are among two million Rwandans who fled civil war and genocide in 1994.</p>
<p>Zairean Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo said in Kigali on Thursday the operation would begin with the closure of all Rwandan refugee camps in Zaire.</p>
<p>&quot;The two heads of government have decided to make operational the organised, massive and unconditional repatriation of all Rwandan refugees,&quot; Kengo said.</p>
<p>&quot;This is going to be carried out rapidly. The repatriation will be enormous and immediate. We are at a stage where Zaire is going to proceed with the closure of the camps.&quot;</p>
<p>Regional analysts said any final decision to expel refugees from Zaire rested with Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko, a close ally of the Hutus, now being treated at a Swiss clinic.</p>
<p>Mobutu has intervened in the past two years to prevent deportation of the refugees, many of whom say they fear being killed in reprisal for Rwanda's genocide if they return home.</p>
