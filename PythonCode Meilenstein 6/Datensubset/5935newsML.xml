<p>The commander of Russian forces in Chechnya brushed aside criticism in Moscow and said on Wednesday rebel forces would not live to hear another warning from him before he launched an assault to win back Grozny.</p>
<p>The comments by Lieutenant-General Vyacheslav Tikhomirov, on his return from leave, publicly demonstrated backing for his deputy Konstantin Pulikovsky who sent refugees fleeing from the Chechen capital this week by setting a deadline for an assault.</p>
<p>President Boris Yeltsin, not seen in public since August 9 when he was sworn in for a second term as president, was on holiday hundreds of km (miles) northwest of Moscow in the Valdai lakeland as the deadline for the attack approached. The Kremlin denied rumours he was ill.</p>
<p>Interfax news agency quoted Tikhomirov as saying he would give no further warning before launching an assault.</p>
<p>&quot;They (the rebels) will not live to see further loose warnings from me,&quot; said Tikhomirov.</p>
<p>Acting commander Pulikovsky had not made clear when his ultimatum started, but the Russian media appeared to assume it would run out at midnight (2000 GMT on Wednesday). He has vowed to use air raids and artillery to pound the rebels. The assault plan, besides arousing criticism overseas, was questioned by Yeltsin's own security supremo Alexander Lebed, himself a retired general.</p>
<p>Lebed, whose future political career may hinge on his ability to find a peaceful solution to the crisis, planned to visit the region later on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Interfax quoted Lebed's spokesman as saying the general hoped to meet separatist leader Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev and rebel chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov.</p>
<p>The policy-making Security Council, of which Lebed is the secretary, on Tuesday questioned the authenticity of Yeltsin's order to win back Grozny.</p>
<p>It said in a statement that carrying out such orders would mean fresh bloodshed and a new wave of resentment at home and abroad. Yeltsin's press office later reprimanded Lebed for making public comments on the president's orders.</p>
<p>Rebels seized control over most of Grozny on August 6 in an operation that humiliated Russian forces.</p>
<p>In a sign of growing concern in the Chechen capital, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) mission, which has been involved in attempts to broker peace, withdrew from Grozny, according to a Swiss diplomat.</p>
<p>&quot;The mission temporarily moved out from Grozny due to the ultimatum, but it definitely will stay in the region to carry out its duties,&quot; said Olaf Kjelsen. The OSCE's Grozny mission is headed by Swiss diplomat Tim Guldimann.</p>
<p>Separatist spokesman Movladi Udugov said on Wednesday that Russian planes had bombed parts of Grozny and other locations in Chechnya overnight. He said that GRAD missiles had been launched at the city from the Russian base of Khankala on its outskirts.</p>
<p>His report could not immediately be confirmed.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of people started fleeing from Grozny after Pulikovsky said he would use warplanes and heavy artillery to clear rebels from the capital of the historically-Moslem southern region.</p>
<p>But on Tuesday Russians appeared to have blocked the main escape route to the northeast of Grozny.</p>
<p>Unlike the first days of the exodus from Grozny, when most were young or middle-aged who found cars, buses, even donkey carts to cram into, a great number are now frail elderly people on foot who had waited until the last moment to get out.</p>
<p>Many in the chaotic crowd were driving cattle or bent over in exhaustion by the roadside under a blazing sun. Black smoke from fires burning in Grozny rose in the sky over their heads.</p>
<p>&quot;I didn't want to leave home but everyone says they are going to bomb everything in the city,&quot; said a toothless old man with one leg whom we gave a lift to.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of people have died in Chechnya since Yeltsin sent troops there in December 1994 to crush the region's independence drive.</p>
<p>Russian liberals called on Yeltsin on Tuesday to avert the threatened attack, which Yelena Bonner, widow of former Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov, said would be a &quot;crime against humanity&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems Boris Yeltsin is unable and does not want to stop the monstrous crime which is being prepared,&quot; Bonner told Ekho Moskvy news agency.</p>
