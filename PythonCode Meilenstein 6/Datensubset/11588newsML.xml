<p>Production and exploration firm Monument Oil and Gas Plc, which earlier reported a 7.9 percent rise in first-half profits, said it hopes to lay the foundations this year for strong future production growth.</p>
<p>The company will start drilling in two North Sea blocks, has high expectations of projects in Pakistan and Colombia and hopes to reach more promising exploration deals soon, chief excutive Tony Craven Walker told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;We have enough projects coming into the company that can have big impact within 12 months,&quot; he said. &quot;This is an exiting period.&quot;  </p>
<p>Monument Oil and Gas' first-half net profit rose to 6.8 million stg from 6.3 million stg.</p>
<p>The company said the rise was held back by delays at the Liverpool Bay fields which came on stream in January.</p>
<p>But problems with offshore processing facilities are expected to be mostly solved by the end of this year, with production picking up at the same time, Monument said.</p>
<p>The exploration and production company, the third largest in Britain, has a 20 percent stake in the Liverpool Bay project.</p>
<p>Monument recently paid 33.3 million stg to shareholders who took up an offer to exchange shares for cash.  </p>
<p>The total amount of cash made available under the offer was 50 million stg. Monument said that the balance of 16.7 million would be retained for future investments.</p>
<p>&quot;The major areas we're looking at are the northern part of South America -- predominantly Colombia -- north Africa, which is Algeria and Libya... and the Caspian area, Turkmenistan, but we are also looking at Kazakhstan,&quot; Craven Walker said.</p>
<p>Monument already signed an oil exploration and production sharing agreement with Turkmenistan earlier this month, but Craven Walker said he wanted to use this deal as a platform for more agreements.  </p>
<p>On Algeria and Lybia, he said, &quot;We are negotiating deals in both countries which we may or may not complete within the next few months but we hope we can.&quot;</p>
<p>Craven Walker said Monument Oil did not fear a recent U.S. law punishing oil and gas investments by foreign firms in Lybia and Iran.</p>
<p>Monument's investments would be too small to be targeted by the new law, while the British firm has no assets in the U.S. which could be subject of any sanctions, he said.</p>
