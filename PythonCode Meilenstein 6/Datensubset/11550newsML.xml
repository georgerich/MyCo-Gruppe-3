<p>Mother Teresa's health has deteriorated and she has malaria, a doctor said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Her cardiac status is unstable and is closely monitored by a team of doctors,&quot; said Dr A.K. Bardhan, one of a team of physicians attending to the Nobel Peace Prize winner. He said the malarial parasite P. vivax had been found in her blood.  </p>
<p>An official at Woodlands Nursing Home where the 85-year-old Roman Catholic missionary has been under treatment since Tuesday said &quot;her condition has deteriorated since the morning&quot;.</p>
<p>Bardhan said Mother Teresa was conscious but continued to have a fever and was on a respirator.</p>
<p>Mother Teresa, regarded by many as a living saint for her devotion to the world's destitute, was admitted to Woodlands, which is a hospital in the eastern Indian city of Calcutta, on Tuesday with high fever.</p>
<p>She developed heart problems on Wednesday, but had responded to treatment and was in stable condition until Friday morning.</p>
