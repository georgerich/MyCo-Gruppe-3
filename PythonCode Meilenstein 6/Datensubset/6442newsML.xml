<p>NYMEX Henry Hub natgas futures moved mostly lower late Wednesday, pressured by talk of softer cash, but prices remained in recent technical ranges with little reason to move far in either direction, sources said.</p>
<p>At 1420 EDT, September eased 1.3 cents to $2.04 per million British thermal units, while October was 1.9 cents lower at $2.105. Most others were steady to down two cents.</p>
<p>&quot;We've had a tough time breaking $2 (in Sept) and we may just hang in this range until expiry (Monday), but the weather doesn't look that supportive,&quot; said one East Coast trader, noting cash was off on soft demand.  </p>
<p>But traders lacked strong conviction about market direction. Bears point to the fact prices failed this week to rally far even when Dolly looked to threaten production in the Gulf. And with mild Midwest and Northeast weather forecast well into next week, they expected the market to remain on the defensive near-term.</p>
<p>Bulls counter by noting that good buying below the market has thwarted several attempts to break support.</p>
<p>A Reuter poll of industry players showed most expected a weekly AGA stock build of 75-85 bcf when the report is released later today, with the East gaining 55-65 bcf.</p>
<p>Cash quotes at the U.S. Gulf Coast were off more than five cents Wednesday to the $2.00-2.05 area, almost 25 cents below August indices. Midcon pipes fell a similar amount to the mid-$1.80s, more than 25 cents below August 1 levels.</p>
<p>NYMEX said 20,958 Henry Hub contracts traded at 1350 EDT.</p>
<p>NYMEX September Henry Hub natgas futures expire Monday, August 26.</p>
<p>NYMEX September Permian natgas fell five cents to $1.77, while deferreds remained untraded at 1420 EDT. NYMEX said three Permian contracts traded at 1350 EDT.</p>
<p>NYMEX September Permian natgas futures expire Wednesday August 28.</p>
<p>On the KCBT, September was still two cents lower at $1.86, while deferreds were steady to down two cents. The East/West spread widened by 0.7 cent to 18 cents (NYMEX premium).</p>
<p>KCBT September natgas futures expire Tuesday, August 27.</p>
