<title>UK: TR European makes improved KEPIT offer.</title>
<headline>TR European makes improved KEPIT offer.</headline>

<p>TR European Growth Trust Plc said on Friday it had made an improved offer for all of the issued ordinary shares and warrants of Kleinwort European Privatisation Investment Trust (KEPIT).  </p>
<p>TR European Growth Trust (TREG) said the improved offers value KEPIT shares and warrants, as at August 19, at 96.2 pence per share on an all cash election and 28.9 pence per warrant on the same basis.</p>
<p>The cash offer for each unit of five KEPIT shares and one KEPIT warrant is 509.9 pence, it added.</p>
<p>&quot;The offers provide an attractive and immediate opportunity for KEPIT investors to receive either cash in respect of their entire holding, at 99.5 percent of KEPIT's formula asset value, or to elect for a combination of cash plus shares and warrants in TREG,&quot; the trust said in a statement.  </p>
<p>The future of KEPIT, a 500 million stg fund, was thrown open when TREG made a bid for it after incumbent managers Kleinwort Benson Investment Management presented plans to turn up to 60 percent into loan stock which it could repurchase to reduce the discount at which the shares trade to the value of the assets.</p>
<p>Proposals from other quarters have also been made. On August 8, Merrill Lynch, which is acting for the trust, said approaches had been received from nine parties.</p>
