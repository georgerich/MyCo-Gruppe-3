<title>NETHERLANDS: Dutch closing share market report.</title>
<headline>Dutch closing share market report.</headline>

<p>Dutch shares closed lower, extending midession losses in late trade as strong U.S. durable goods orders triggered a slide in bond prices.</p>
<p>Trading was thin and volatile but after a choppy end to the week, shares were still up slightly on week-ago levels.</p>
<p>The AEX index of 25 blue chip shares closed down 4.22 points at 560.73 but above the previous week's close of 557.42.</p>
<p>The index hit an early high of 569.25 in an attempt to follow through on Thursday's rate-cut inspired gains, but profit-taking quickly choked the rise.  </p>
<p>Some dealers felt the market would break its previous all-time closing high of 571.76 from June 6.</p>
<p>&quot;Eventually we should be able to set new highs, though perhaps not at the first attempt, because company earnings are so strong,&quot; said one.</p>
<p>Others predicted further volatility with share prices, tossed to and fro depending on whether the latest economic data signalled economic strength -- and the prospect of higher interest rates -- or weakness.</p>
<p>One dealer said most fund managers were still trying to get a feel for market direction after the summer holidays.  </p>
<p>&quot;A lot of people missed the opportunity to buy when the index dipped to 510/520 in July. They missed the rally which followed and now they're scared to pay too much,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Post and telecoms group Dutch PTT was one of the biggest losers on Friday, shedding 2.10 guilders at 60.60 after first-half profits at the low end of market expectations.</p>
<p>Net profit rose to 1.21 billion guilders from 1.11 billion while forecasts had ranged from 1.21 billion to 1.24 billion.</p>
<p>But food group Nutricia jumped 18 guilders to 210.00 after reporting late on Thursday a 51 percent profit rise which was boosted by its acquisition of Germany baby food firm Milupa.</p>
