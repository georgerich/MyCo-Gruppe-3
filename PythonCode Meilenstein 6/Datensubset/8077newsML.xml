<p>An Iranian exile group based in Iraq vowed on Thursday to extend support to Iran's Kurdish rebels after they were attacked by Iranian troops deep inside Iraq last month.</p>
<p>A Mujahideen Khalq statement said its leader Massoud Rajavi met in Baghdad the Secretary-General of the Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iran (KDPI) Hassan Rastegar on Wednesday and voiced his support to Iran's rebel Kurds.</p>
<p>&quot;Rajavi emphasised that the Iranian Resistance would continue to stand side by side with their Kurdish compatriots and the resistance movement in Iranian Kurdistan,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the group said the meeting &quot;signals a new level of cooperation between Mujahideen Khalq and the Iranian Kurdish oppositions&quot;.</p>
<p>Iran heavily bombarded targets in northern Iraq in July in pursuit of KDPI guerrillas based in Iraqi Kurdish areas outside the control of the government in Baghdad.</p>
<p>Iraqi Kurdish areas bordering Iran are under the control of guerrillas of the Iraqi Kurdish Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) group.</p>
<p>PUK and Iraq's Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) the two main Iraqi Kurdish factions, have had northern Iraq under their control since Iraqi forces were ousted from Kuwait in the 1991 Gulf War.</p>
<p>Clashes between the two parties broke out at the weekend in the most serious fighting since a U.S.-sponsored ceasefire last year.</p>
<p>Mujahideen Khalq said Iranian troops had also been shelling KDP positions in Qasri region in Suleimaniya province near the Iranian border over the last two days.</p>
<p>It said about 100 Iraqi Kurds were killed or wounded in the attack.</p>
<p>Both Iran and Turkey mount air and land strikes at targets in northern Iraq in pursuit of their own Kurdish rebels.</p>
