<p>NWE gas oil was mostly steady but with a softer undertone as traders reported many more sellers than buyers in the market.</p>
<p>A handful of buyers came into the market to cover prompt requirements, but most were holding back in the hope that benchmark futures would fall further.</p>
<p>Balance of August barges traded at Sept IPE +$1 early in the day, but bids were seen at a stubborn Sept IPE +75 cents for Rotterdam refinery material later on.</p>
<p>A German trader offering a Russian cargo with Aug 24-25 delivery dates pegged premiums at Sept IPE +$1.50/$2 cif ARA.</p>
<p>Patchy demand was seen for low sulphur diesel into France and Germany. A Scandinavian refiner was rumoured to have picked up a 5,000 tonne parcel into Bremen, but this could not be confirmed.</p>
<p>German DIN talked steady with offers at Sept IPE +$3/$2.50 cif Hamburg and bids at Sept IPE +$1.50/+$2.</p>
<p>Sept IPE gas oil settled 25 cents lower at $188.25 a tonne. The Sept/Oct backwardation shed 75 cents, under pressure from expectations that weekly US stock data would show an inventory build.</p>
