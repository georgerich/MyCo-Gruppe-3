<p>Boris Yeltsin's new security chief plunged Moscow politics into chaos on Tuesday, challenging the authenticity of presidential decrees on the Chechnya crisis and raising speculation on whether Yeltsin was still running Russia.</p>
<p>Aides to the 65-year-old president, seen only once in public since he was re-elected seven weeks ago, insisted he was not ill but he remained out of sight.</p>
<p>His spokesman denied a new report he was being treated for a serious heart condition and said he had left Moscow for a short holiday.</p>
<p>Tough-talking ex-general Alexander Lebed, just two months in his job as Security Council secretary and already at loggerheads with some Kremlin insiders, issued a statement saying Yeltsin's latest decrees on Chechnya bore only a facsimile signature and seemed to have been prepared without his participation.</p>
<p>A decree ordering Lebed to restore Russian control of Grozny, which was seized by separatist rebels on August 6, was the cue for the army to prepare a massive bombardment of the Chechen capital and would wreck Lebed's peacemaking efforts, the Security Council statement said.</p>
<p>Lebed, whom Yeltsin named his personal representative to Chechnya last week, would make his third trip in 10 days to the region on Wednesday, Itar-Tass news agency said.</p>
<p>Yeltsin started a two-day break in the picturesque lakeland of Valdai in northwestern Russia on Tuesday, the presidential press service said.</p>
<p>Spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said Yeltsin would consider a longer holiday in Valdai but dismissed as &quot;complete rubbish&quot; a report by Ekho Moskvy radio that the president had been in a specialist cardiological centre since August 15.</p>
<p>Journalists at Ekho Moskvy told Reuters they stuck by their story. which said Yeltsin, who had two heart attacks last year, had been diagnosed as having moderately serious heart trouble.</p>
<p>&quot;In the coming hours the question of carrying out a surgical operation may be decided,&quot; the radio said.</p>
<p>Yastrzhembsky on Monday had denied a Time magazine report that the Kremlin was considering transferring Yeltsin to a Swiss clinic for a bypass operation.</p>
<p>He said the president and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, who would deputise for Yeltsin if he were incapable of working, were continuing to work on formation of the new government, most of which was announced last week.</p>
<p>There was no immediate response to Lebed's charges.</p>
<p>&quot;The contents of the documents give solid grounds to doubt that the president of Russia took a direct part in finalising the text of the order,&quot; the Security Council statement said.</p>
<p>The decree, it added, had given the army commander in the region his cue to announce he would launch an all-out air and artillery bombardment of the city from Thursday morning, having given tens of thousands of citizens 48 hours to flee.</p>
<p>Terrified civilians flooded out of Grozny on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The refugees, many of them with little more than the clothes they stood up in, said Russian planes had started bombing the town, much of it already in ruins after attacks at the start of Russia's campaign to crush Chechnya's independence bid.</p>
<p>&quot;The whole city is on its way out,&quot; said Nina Madayeva, who said 12 planes had bombed Grozny's southwestern Chernorechye district overnight. &quot;We've been in a basement for 14 or 15 days and couldn't stand it any more.&quot;</p>
<p>Russian commander, General Konstantin Pulikovsky, who had signed a ceasefire order on Saturday, accused the guerrillas of using the truce to dig in.</p>
<p>&quot;I see force as the only way out of the situation in Grozny,&quot; he told Interfax news agency.</p>
<p>Rebel chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov appealed to Lebed, who has held talks with the rebels, to rein in Pulikovsky's troops.</p>
<p>He should &quot;use all of his influence to stop the approaching madness&quot;, Interfax quoted Maskhadov as saying.</p>
