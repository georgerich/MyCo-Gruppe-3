<p>Turkish troops have killed 17 Kurdish rebels in recent clashes in the southeast of the country, the state-run Anatolian news agency said on Friday.</p>
<p>Two security officials and two state-paid village guards were killed in the fighting with Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) guerrillas, the agency quoted the emergency rule governor's office as saying.</p>
<p>Eight of the rebels were killed in Van province, five in Sirnak and four in Hakkari. The agency did not say when the clashes took place.</p>
<p>More than 20,000 people have died in the PKK's 12-year-old fight for independence or autonomy in southeastern Turkey.</p>
<p>Three people, including two village guards, died when a mine planted by PKK rebels exploded on a road in the southeast, Anatolian reported earlier.</p>
<p>It said a taxi carrying the guards, members of a mostly Kurdish militia which fights the PKK, hit the mine in the province of Diyarbakir.</p>
