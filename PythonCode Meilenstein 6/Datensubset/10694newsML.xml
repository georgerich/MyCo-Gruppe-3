<p>A California legislative committee moved closer on Friday to finalizing a plan to help investor-owned utilities write-off &quot;stranded&quot; costs to better compete in a deregulated California market.</p>
<p>The joint Assembly-Senate conference committee was now expected to finalize its proposed legislation by Monday, state officials working with the committee said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;This proposal is very nearly done,&quot; said David Takashima, chief of staff to state Senator Steve Peace, conference committee chairman.  </p>
<p>&quot;We believe that by the close of this month, both the state Senate and Assembly would approve it. We also have indications the Governor would be supportive of signing this legislation,&quot; Takashima added.</p>
<p>Lawmakers on the committee have agreed that as of January 1998, electric utility customers in the state would have a choice of providers. Under the proposal, however, municipal utilities would not be required to open their markets.</p>
<p>To help investor-owned utilities in the state write-off their stranded costs, the state would enact a statewide competitive transition charge, Takashima said.  </p>
<p>The amount of the charge would be set by the California Public Utilities Commission. The charge would be collected through the year 2001, Takashima said.</p>
<p>While this charge was in place, investor-owned utility rates in the state would be frozen, he added.</p>
<p>The competitive transition charge could be used by the utilities to directly write-off stranded costs such as nuclear power facilities and certain facility contracts.</p>
<p>Under a companion proposal by Senator Peace, the utilities could issue through the state infrastructure bank an estimated $5 billion in revenue bonds backed by the transition charge.  </p>
<p>&quot;They might be non-taxable instruments, we're not sure yet,&quot; Takashima said.</p>
<p>The bonds could provide savings to the utilities, and those savings, under Peace's proposal, could be passed on to small business and residential customers in the form of a 10 percent rate reduction, Takashima said.</p>
