<p>Spot electricity in the U.S. Mid Atlantic fell Thursday on forecasts of cool weather beginning next week and following through to the end of August, industry sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's really coming off, we're going to see some cool temperatures next week,&quot; said one New York-based marketer.</p>
<p>Prices in the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) power pool for next day, on peak delivery were talked in the $29.00-31.00 range with unconfirmed trades reported at $29.00 and 29.25, brokers and marketers said. Next day power was talked at $31.00-34.00 on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Next day off peak power was thinly discussed at $16.00-17.00, the sources said.</p>
<p>Power for the five business days of next week was talked down to $21.00-22.00 from a range of $24.00-25.00 yesterday.</p>
<p>September PJM for firm, peak delivery, was assessed down to $21.50-22.00 from a range of $22.20-22.75 on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Prices start moving as a result of the impression of what the market is going to do,&quot; said one trader. &quot;If it's $22 for 75 degrees (Fahrenheit) then people ask what are we going to have when it's 65 (degrees Fahrenheit), and so they look at September as overvalued.&quot;</p>
