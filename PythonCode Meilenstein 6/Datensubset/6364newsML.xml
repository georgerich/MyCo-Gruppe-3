<p>A nine-foot (2.7-meter) Burmese python bit a pregnant woman in a San Diego hotel room on Wednesday, then wrapped itself around her and her husband before rescuers beheaded the family pet, police said.</p>
<p>The incident began on Wednesday morning when the English couple allowed the 3-year-old python -- their family pet for the past two months -- to slither onto the hotel bed.</p>
<p>&quot;For some inexplicable reason, the python bit the woman on the thumb and on the butt and then wrapped itself around her,&quot; said San Diego police spokesman Bill Robinson.</p>
<p>With the couple's two young children looking on, the man stabbed the python with a pen-knife in an attempt to free his wife, who was eight months pregnant, and the snake then coiled itself around his arm, Robinson said.</p>
<p>The man managed to call police, and when fire department paramedics arrived, they used a small hacksaw to cut off the python's head.</p>
<p>The woman did not require medical attention.</p>
<p>Police said the python had been fed a large guinea-pig two days ago, so it was probably not looking for food when it attacked the woman.</p>
