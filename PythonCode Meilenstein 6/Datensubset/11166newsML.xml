<p>Lima shares closed moderately higher on bargain-hunting in a session overshadowed by a large cross of benchmark Telefonica del Peru.</p>
<p>Brokers saw stable trading at the beginning of next week, with attractively low prices and companies' good perspectives possibly producing some rises.</p>
<p>On Friday, the General Index  .IGRA rose 0.76 percent to 1,406.80 points, while the blue-chip Selective Index  .ISEL gained 1.16 percent to 1,922.25. Total volume was 174 million soles ($70.5 million) in 2,419 operations, with 37 stocks rising, 44 flat and 19 falling.  </p>
<p>Telefonica accounted for 84.5 percent of trade, mainly due to a 25.65 million share cross by local brokerage Bolsa Wiese at the stocks's closing price of 5.58 soles.</p>
<p>Telefonica rose 1.82 percent during the session on total trade of 26.36 million shares.</p>
<p>Brokers said investors were attracted on Friday by low prices, particularly in the brewery sector.</p>
<p>&quot;The shares in the brewery sector, so representative of the market, were already attractive due to various days of falls which encouraged investors to take long-term positions,&quot; said Augusto Larco, of Peruval brokerage.  </p>
<p>Brokers added that the electricity sector had slowed its aggressive trading on Friday but this did not represent a weakening of investor interest in those shares.</p>
<p>&quot;The electricity shares did not move like previous sessions, but that does not mean there is no interest, there are still buyers,&quot; said Pablo Navarro, of Fortuna brokerage.</p>
<p>Brewery Compania Nacional de Cerveza led Friday's gains with a 5.06 percent rise to 0.83 soles on 316,323 shares, while Cervecera Backus y Johnston was up 2.08 percent to 2.45 soles on 775,435 shares and Cervesur gained 1.60 soles on 226,558 shares.</p>
<p>Electricity company Edegel gained 3.1 percent to 3.44 soles, while Luz del Sur closed flat on 3.60 soles.</p>
