<p>NYMEX electricity futures ended mostly lower Tuesday, although the California-Oregon Border (COB) front months finished higher in a late rally that traders said was difficult to account for.</p>
<p>The futures may have been following physicals prices, which firmed in the Northwest and fell in the Southwest, in part due to lower natural gas prices, industry sources said.</p>
<p>September COB finished up 30 cents at $17.90 after trading as low as $17.55 per megawatt hour (MWh), while October closed 18 cents higher at $15.83 after trade as low as $15.65.</p>
<p>Remaining COB deferreds, with the exception of June, 1997 closed 15-55 cents lower. Futures prices for the winter months have been decreasing over the past week.</p>
<p>&quot;People trading the back months are probably looking at what is happening to the front months, which rallied for two to three weeks and now are coming off pretty hard,&quot; said one New York-based futures broker.</p>
<p>September Palo Verde (PV) ended down 30 cents at $20.90, while October PV ended down 30 cents at $16.10.</p>
<p>Remaining PV deferreds ended down 15-70 cents.</p>
<p>NYMEX said an estimated total of 316 COB contracts traded, while an estimated 42 PV contracts traded.</p>
