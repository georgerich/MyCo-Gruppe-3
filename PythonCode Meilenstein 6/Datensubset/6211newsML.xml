<p>Jakarta share prices closed higher on Wednesday on the back of bargain-hunting in selected big-capitalised stocks and secondliners, brokers said.</p>
<p>The Jakarta composite index rose 2.60 points, or 0.48 percent, to 542.20 points. Gainers led losers by 45 to 39, with 53 counters unchanged.</p>
<p>Brokers said overall trading was moderate with more bargain hunters came in to floor, bought selected big-capitalised stocks which had discounted since Jakarta riot on July.  </p>
<p>&quot;Some stocks were already too cheap, so I think its only a technical and temporary rebound,&quot; said Heriadi, broker of Mashill Jaya Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;But overall market sentiment remains volatile on political news coupled with inconsistencies in macroeconomy policy,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Property firm Duta Anggada topped the active list with 15.6 million shares traded, rising 50 rupiah to 2,375 following continued market talk that the company had finalised a joint venture agreement with Singapore-based property firm.  </p>
<p>Another secondliner stock Bank Duta rose sharply in late afternoon trading on market talk of a possible management restructure and new syndicated loans.</p>
<p>Bank Duta rose 24.56 percent, or 350 rupiah, to 1,775 rupiah on a volume of 2.2 million shares.</p>
<p>Brokers said blue chip telecommunication firm PT Indosat and cement producer PT Indocement were the target of bargain-hunters.</p>
