<headline>Complaints surge over UK &quot;demonic&quot; political ads.</headline>

<p>A British industry watchdog said on Tuesday it had been flooded with complaints about an advertising campaign that depicted opposition Labour leader Tony Blair with demonic eyes.</p>
<p>The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) told Reuters it had received about 100 complaints and would decide in a few days whether the campaign broke rules that ban offensive ads and those that unfairly infringe on the privacy of public figures.</p>
<p>If the rules were breached by the ads, which were run by the incumbent Conservative Party in British newspapers this month, the ASA will ban the ads.</p>
<p>&quot;The advertising industry itself doesn't want political advertising to degenerate into mud-slinging,&quot; an advertising industry source told Reuters.</p>
<p>The ASA has received written responses to the complaints from M&amp;C Saatchi, the advertising agency that created the campaign and that was started last year by Maurice Saatchi and his brother, Charles.</p>
<p>The Saatchi brothers were ousted in December 1994 from Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising, which they formed in 1970.</p>
<p>The ads showed Tony Blair with a manic grin and red demonic eyes gleaming out from behind a black strip.</p>
<p>British newspapers this week quoted the actor whose eyes were used for the ads, Scott Woods, as saying he was upset about the campaign.</p>
<p>He told newspapers he had known photos of his eyes were being used for a Conservative Party campaign, but not that they would be used to make Blair look evil.</p>
<p>Woods, who specialises in playing serial killers, pirates and demons because of his mad, staring eyes, said he was a Labour supporter and planned to vote for Blair.</p>
