<p>The 21st-century land grab to register desirable Internet addresses may be about to cool.</p>
<p>The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority, which oversees certain Internet standards, has decided to give out several new licenses to firms that will register new top-level or &quot;domain&quot; names starting in 1997, authority head Jon Postel said in a telephone interview Thursday.</p>
<p>Currently, Network Solutions Inc. of Herndon, Va., has the sole license from the authority to register address names in the most common top-level categories.</p>
<p>Most Internet addresses end with one of a few three-letter designations, including &quot;com&quot; for commercial sites, &quot;gov&quot; for government sites and &quot;edu&quot; for sites run by schools.</p>
<p>The availability of new names and competing registration services should help quell disputes over popular or trademarked names, attorneys and Internet specialists said.</p>
<p>Network Solutions registers names for sites in those three so-called top-level domains, along with &quot;org&quot; and &quot;net,&quot; charging $100 for a two-year registration.</p>
<p>That greatly limits the number of available names, creating competition and even bidding wars for prestige monikers like &quot;television.com&quot; or &quot;cybercafe.com.&quot;</p>
<p>Disputes are arising more frequently, usually when the holder of a trademark discovers that someone else is using their trademark as the name of an Internet site.</p>
<p>For example, Viacom Inc.'s MTV cable music channel fought with Adam Curry, a &quot;vee-jay&quot; who registered &quot;mtv.com&quot; as an Internet name. MTV eventually regained control of the name in an out-of-court settlement.</p>
<p>Once new top-level domain names are available, three or four people could register similiar names.</p>
<p>The numbers authority is appointing a committee that will review applications from companies interested in registering names under the new top-level domains, Postel said. Ultimately, a few companies will be given authority over three new top-level domains each, he said.</p>
<p>The committee will begin accepting applications in October and new names could be in service by the end of January.</p>
<p>The registration companies will be able to set their own prices, with a small percentage of the fees going into a fund to improve the Internet's central infrastructure, Postel said.</p>
<p>&quot;With competition, you're using market forces to get lower prices and better services,&quot; Postel said.</p>
<p>Network Solutions officials were not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>Additional top-level names should help resolve disputes over trademarked names by providing more options, perhaps allowing similar names under different domains.</p>
<p>However, particularly well-known trademarks owned by major companies, such as McDonalds Corp., are likely to retain sole Internet rights in any domain.</p>
<p>Network Solutions generally recognises holders of federally registered trademarks while ignoring other forms of legally recognised trademarks such as common law trademarks, attorneys said.</p>
<p>&quot;You can have multiple trademarks for the identical mark (name), provided the goods or services are unrelated,&quot; said Jere Webb, an intellectual property attorney at Stoel Rives in Portland, Ore.</p>
<p>&quot;Companies are going beserk when they discover that their name with '.com' after it has already been grabbed by somebody else,&quot; Webb said. &quot;If they can't do anything about it, which in many cases they can't because it is for unrelated goods or services, then they are in a quandary. This would give them some avenue or out.&quot;</p>
