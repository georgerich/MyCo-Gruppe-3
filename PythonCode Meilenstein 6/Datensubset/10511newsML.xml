<p>Brokerage ING Barings said on Friday it had cut its 1997 earnings per share forecast for Dutch publisher De Telegraaf to 16.25 guilders from 17.00.</p>
<p>ING Barings said this was caused by Thursday's news that De Telegraaf had lost a contract with Dutch broadcaster TROS for which it has been printing TV guides for 30 years.</p>
<p>The contract involves 40 million guilders in turnover, four percent of De Telegraaf's annual sales, and 2.5 percent of the company's total workforce.</p>
<p>&quot;As a result we are recalculating our estimates,&quot; ING Barings said in its daily market comment.</p>
<p>The brokerage said the impact would be felt in De Telegraaf's 1997 figures but added it would not be surprised if the publisher launched a new TV guide of its own.</p>
<p>It added it reiterated the stock's Buy recommendation given the low valuation.</p>
<p>ING Barings said De Telegraaf's shares would become very attractive once the stock price came under pressure as a result of losing the TROS contract from 1997.</p>
