<p>Colombia's peso extended last Friday's gains in active trading on the country's interbank market, closing up 9.85 pesos on the dollar at 1,038.15.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a volatile session,&quot; one dealer said, noting that peso had weakened early in the day as oversold banks and the public sector demanded dollars.</p>
<p>It swung back up ahead of the close, however, on what dealers described as a flood of dollar sales by oil and coffee exporters.</p>
<p>Financial markets were closed Monday in observance of a national religious holiday.  </p>
<p>The peso, which gained eight pesos on the dollar Friday, traded in a 1,035.50 to 1,047.60 range in Tuesday's trade and dealers reported a high-than-average 437 trades for a total of $176 million.</p>
<p>The peso has appreciated significantly since late June when it traded around 1,070 to the dollar.</p>
<p>The rise -- which makes Colombian goods including coffee more expensive abroad -- has prompted the government to urge the central bank to weaken the peso as part of a bid to shore up the export sector and and refuel flagging economic growth.  </p>
<p>The central bank, which is fiercely independent and likes a stronger currency as a curb against inflation, has insisted that it will not alter the exchange rate bands it sets daily to undercut the peso to the administration's tune.</p>
