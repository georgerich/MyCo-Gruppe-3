<title>SINGAPORE: United Overseas Land sees better 1996.</title>

<p>Hotel and property company United Overseas Land said on Thursday that it expects its results in 1996 to be better than 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;...the outlook for the hotel industry in Australia is positive and this should benefit the Group's hotel investments there,&quot; it said in its interim results statement.  </p>
<p>UOL said this was in contrast to a competitive hotel industry in Singapore where 10 new hotels have opened or are due to open in 1996.</p>
<p>United Overseas Land expects the Singapore residential property market to remain dull afer the government introduced a package of measures in May this year to curb speculation.</p>
<p>&quot;However, demand for office space is expected to remain steady,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>&quot;Against this background and barring unforeseen circumstances, the directors expect the results for the year 1996 will be better than those for the previous year.&quot;  </p>
<p>For the six months ended June 30 1996, the company saw its turnover rise by 30 percent to Singapore $142 million from S$109.2 million previously. The increase was partly due to the inclusion of revenues from the Landmark Parkroyal Hotel and the Sheraton Perth Hotel which were acquired in March and December 1995 respectively.</p>
<p>It said its earnings were eroded by higher interest expense and sharply lower investment income.</p>
