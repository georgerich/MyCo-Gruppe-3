<p>Brazilian stocks closed down in moderate dealings as benchmark Telebras seesawed in speculative trade to end flat and most other shares closed broadly lower, weighed down by Argentine losses, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Towards the end of the day, rumors about problems in Argentina brought the market down,&quot; said John Carioba of Indusval brokerage.</p>
<p>The Sao Paulo bourse's Bovespa index of 52 most traded shares lost 223 points to close at 63,148 points, off 0.35 percent from Tuesday.  </p>
<p>Volume reached 349 million reais, mostly made up of trade in Telebras shares and options.</p>
<p>Brokers said prices rose early after Tuesday's gains, but lost steam following the 0.55 percent decline in the Dow Jones and a 3.37 percent plunge in Argentina's MerVal index.</p>
<p>&quot;There were rumors of yet another package of (austerity) measures&quot; to be unveiled by Buenos Aires, a dealer said.</p>
<p>Telebras preferred fluctuated on speculation through much of the day, closing flat at 76.30 reais.</p>
<p>&quot;We saw some of the large players pulling it down, then some buying brought it up again,&quot; a broker said.  </p>
<p>The bolsa was affected mostly by foreign stock markets, including Mexico's rise, due to a lack of local market-moving news, brokers said.</p>
<p>While Telebras preferred ended flat, its common rose a slight 0.31 percent higher at 61.70 reais.</p>
<p>But most other stocks dropped, led by a 3.37 percent decline in Banco Itau preferred and a 3.23 percent fall in Cemig preferred.</p>
<p>Top gainers were Telepar preferred, which rose 4.7 percent to 471.00 reais, and power firm Compania Paulista de Forca e Luz, up 3.2 percent at 65.00 reais.  </p>
<p>The bolsa's Electrical Energy Index (IEE) of the nine most liquid power shares followed other shares downward, slipping 0.19 percent to end at 1,578 points.</p>
<p>State-owned power firm Eletrobras's preferred B mirrored the Bovespa index, slipping 0.35 percent to end at 285.00 reais.</p>
