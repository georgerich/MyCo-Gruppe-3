<p>Russian security chief Alexander Lebed signed a deal with separatists in Chechnya on Thursday, promising to withdraw government forces to end three weeks of bloodshed in Grozny, the Chechen capital.</p>
<p>&quot;Troops will be withdrawn from Grozny because constitutional order cannot be introduced using air and artillery strikes. They will be withdrawn from the whole of Chechnya,&quot; a triumphant Lebed told reporters in this village about 20 kms (12 miles) south of Grozny.</p>
<p>Moscow's forces have been attacking Grozny to try to oust rebels who seized it in a raid on August 6 that humiliated the Russian military. The separatists said the attack was in retaliation for Russian bombardments of Chechen villages.</p>
<p>The Russian attacks followed a deal with the rebels for disarmament in return for step-by-step troop withdrawals from the mainly Moslem region to be completed by September 1.</p>
<p>Truces have come and gone in 20 months of the Chechen conflict, and it was too soon to say whether the new deal would bring respite for civilians who have been fleeing Grozny in tens of thousands since the raid began.</p>
<p>It was also unclear how much power Lebed actually wields. Though President Boris Yeltsin appointed him his special envoy to Chechnya, Security Council secretary and security adviser, he criticised him in an interview earlier on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;I am not completely satisfied with Lebed's performance in Chechnya,&quot; Yeltsin told RIA news agency in an interview shown in a television feed.</p>
<p>Lebed predicted further criticism from his many opponents in Moscow -- democrats and hardliners alike. But he seemed not to care, saying: &quot;Anyone who is unhappy is welcome to complain.&quot;</p>
<p>The exact text of the deal, signed by two of the more compromising figures on the two sides, was not available.</p>
<p>But Itar-Tass news agency said it provided for disengagement of Russian and rebel forces battling for 20 months in Chechnya and Lebed provided some pointers as he spoke amid a crowd of about 100 reporters, bodyguards and onlookers.</p>
<p>&quot;Joint military administrations will be set up in Grozny to protect the city from looters and bandits,&quot; Lebed said.</p>
<p>&quot;I will come back with a draft political agreement in two days. We will discuss it and sign it,&quot; he added. That deal would also address the root of the fighting -- Chechnya's status.</p>
<p>Lebed said forces would start withdrawing tomorrow from southern Chechnya and joint military administrations would be set up at the same time.</p>
<p>A deadline for a Russian assault on Grozny had passed quietly on Thursday morning as Lebed held a second day of talks.</p>
<p>Interfax news agency the two sides were discussing a nine-point deal which addressed the situation in Grozny, separating the fighters, stopping looting and averting clashes.</p>
<p>Lebed's press spokesman Alexander Barkhatov told reporters the two sides were working out a &quot;day-by-day schedule&quot; to stop the fighting.</p>
<p>Yeltsin appointed Lebed his security chief after the former paratrooper captured around 15 percent of the votes in the first round of Russia's presidential election this year.</p>
<p>But he criticised him after the talks began but before the deal was signed, saying: &quot;We must remember, when he met voters he always promised to solve the Chechen problem if he had power. Now he has power. But unfortunately the results of his work are not yet obvious.</p>
<p>&quot;But we must not despair, we will take this issue to the end,&quot; Yeltsin added.</p>
<p>More than 30,000 people have been killed in the breakaway North Caucasus region since Yeltsin sent in his forces in December 1994 to end an independence drive.</p>
<p>The latest battles have killed many hundreds and sent tens of thousands fleeing. Expectations that Grozny would be bombed on Thursday, after a Russian commander issued an ultimatum to rebels who have seized the city, sparked a fresh exodus.</p>
