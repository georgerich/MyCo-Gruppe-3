<p>The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which has pulled its mission out of Grozny, said on Wednesday developments in Chechnya were giving rise to serious concern.</p>
<p>The OSCE chairman-in-office, Swiss Foreign Minister Flavio Cotti, urged those involved in the conflict not to resort to violence but to observe the ceasefire and seek a peaceful settlement.</p>
<p>&quot;The developments in the last two days have given rise to very serious concerns in view of the danger of a major military confrontation in Grozny which would cause significant loss of life and suffering, in particular among the civilian population,&quot; Cotti said in a statement issued from OSCE headquarters in Vienna.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the European security forum confirmed an earlier statement from a Swiss diplomat in Moscow who said the OSCE had withdrawn its mission from the Chechen capital.</p>
<p>&quot;The mission has moved out for the time being and set up in neighbouring Ingushetia,&quot; the spokesman said, adding that the mission would continue its work.</p>
<p>Russia's acting commander of forces in Chechnya threatened on Monday to bomb Grozny if rebels, who captured most of the city on August 6, did not withdraw in 48 hours.</p>
<p>But Russian President Boris Yeltsin's security chief Alexander Lebed, who is intent on resolving the Chechnya conflict peacefully, said the issue of the Russian military's ultimatum to bomb rebels in Grozny would be resolved by Thursday morning, Itar-Tass news agency reported.</p>
