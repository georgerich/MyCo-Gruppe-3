<p>Australian shares are likely to follow Australian bonds and the Australian dollar lower when they open for trade on Wednesday following the first budget by the five-month old Coalition government, analysts said.  </p>
<p>Economists said there was not much in the budget that would affect the equities market, except perhaps for the cut in the research and development tax deduction rate for compnies and a go-ahead for banks to operate pension-savings accounts.</p>
<p>During a special late trading session on the Sydney Futures Exchange, the Australian Shares Price Index (SPI) fell six points to 2270 points, compared with a close of 2283 at the end of normal trade, narrowing the premium to the underlying index.</p>
<p>The Australian All Ordinaries closed at 2264.7 points.  </p>
<p>&quot;The sharemarket will probably react a little bit like the bond market and the currency market has tonight,&quot; ANB AMRO economist Susan Creighton told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;It is probably not as good as the market expected, because they have built in such high expectations. There might be a little bit of disappointment,&quot; Creighton said.</p>
<p>The Australian sharemarket hit a three-month high on Tuesday on expectations that the budget would be tough on cutting the nation's budget deficit and open the possibility for a rate cut.</p>
<p>Treasurer Peter Costello, who brought down the budget, said he would like an interest rate cut by the end of calendar 1996.  </p>
<p>&quot;The thing that could well keep the equity market buoyed is that Costello is certainly keeping alive the rate cut hope and that is certainly affecting the Aussie dollar tonight,&quot; Creighton said.</p>
<p>By 9.45 p.m. (1145 GMT), the Australian dollar had sunk to US$0.7863/68 from a pre-budget $0.7883/88, while 10-year bond yield rose to eight percent at one stage compared with 7.93 ahead of the budget announcement.  </p>
<p>The Treasurer announced an underlying budget deficit of A$5.65 billion and a headline budget surplus of A$474 million for 1996/97 after budget savings of A$3.9 billion. Median forecasts had an underlying deficit of A$4.9 billion.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the stocks will take the cue from the bond market. There is nothing in the budget that is anything equities,&quot; said Prudential-Bache Securities chief economist Dennis Mahoney.</p>
