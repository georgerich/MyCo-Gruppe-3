<p>Kmart Corp. reported a second-quarter profit Wednesday after 13 straight quarters of disappointing results as cost-cutting and improvement at its Builders Square building supply stores offset sluggish sales.</p>
<p>The nation's second-largest retailer said it earned $34 million, or 7 cents a share, for the period ended July 31. It was the first quarter in more than three years that the retailer has not posted a loss or a drop in quarterly results.</p>
<p>During last year's second quarter, Kmart lost $54 million, or 12 cents a share, which included a loss of $76 million on the disposal of discontinued operations.</p>
<p>&quot;We're seeing evidence that the turnaround is beginning to take hold,&quot; said Kmart spokesman Robert Burton. &quot;It's too early to declare victory but it's not too early to say we're making progress.&quot;</p>
<p>Steep cuts in employment costs and the divestiture of businesses with heavy expenses, including the sale of 860 auto service centers to a unit of Penske Corp.,  helped lift earnings, industry analysts said.</p>
<p>Kmart has cut 30,000 workers over the last year. Some of those jobs were eliminated through the closing of about 220 stores in the last 18 months.</p>
<p>But the Troy, Mich.,-based discount store chain's sales remain soft. Total sales fell (Corrects from rose) 1.5 percent to $8.3 billion in the quarter, and comparable-store sales, or sales among stores open a year, rose just 2.2 percent at Kmart's discount stores in the United States, trailing rivals Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Target, owned by Dayton Hudson Corp..</p>
<p>The results &quot;are evidence management is moving in the right direction,&quot; said Richard Church at brokerage Smith Barney. &quot;But you haven't seen top-line improvement. It's all coming from expense reductions.&quot;</p>
<p>Kmart's biggest challenge is winning back customers it lost to competitors such as Wal-Mart, analysts said. But this could take years as Kmart's new merchandise executives overhaul clothing offerings and new systems to better manage inventories kick in.</p>
<p>&quot;At the end of the day, this is a company that needs to steal back customers and change its customer profile, and that's going to take some time,&quot; said Marc Kutik, director of high-yield research at NatWest Markets.</p>
<p>Kmart said sales of clothing and items such as small appliances and light bulbs were disappointing. But sales of lower-profit merchandise such as snack food, soap and paper towels was strong.</p>
<p>Some of the pressure on profits has stemmed from price competition from other discounters and large chain stores. While Kmart has whittled down costs by getting rid of high-expense businesses, it also has given up profit.</p>
<p>Last month, Kmart agreed to turn over the operation of the restaurants inside 1,850 Kmart stores to a joint venture it will form with Daka International Inc..</p>
<p>Kmart's Builders Square chain of building supply stores reported profits rose 111 percent to $19 million in the second quarter.</p>
<p>Builders Square remains on the auction block, and Kmart has had talks with potential buyers, although company spokesman Burton would not say if a deal was near.</p>
<p>Analysts said Kmart would rather wait to sell the troubled chain after profits recover further than accept a low bid.</p>
<p>Kmart stock rose 25 cents to $10.75 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
