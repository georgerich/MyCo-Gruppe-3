<headline>S.Africa's PAC admits targeting white civilians.</headline>

<p>South Africa's radical black Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) on Tuesday acknowledged that its guerrillas targeted white civilians but said it made no apologies.</p>
<p>PAC leader Clarence Makwetu told the Truth and Reconciliation Commission commission, headed by Archbishop Desmond Tutu, that the PAC regretted the 1993 killing of American student Amy Biehl in a black township outside Cape Town by youths allied to the organisation.</p>
<p>Discussing the activities of the PAC's armed wing, the Azanian People's Liberation Army (APLA), Makwetu said &quot;a new pattern arose in the 1990s where civilians within the white community were attacked&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The actual targets were decided by local commanders... operatives often made errors that APLA had earlier avoided.&quot;</p>
<p>Makwetu described the killing of civilians as &quot;departures which we as political leaders who declared war must and do take responsibility for&quot;.</p>
<p>But he added: &quot;We make no apologies. We have nothing to hide.&quot;</p>
<p>The Truth and Reconciliation Commission is hearing submissions this week from political parties aimed at giving a broad perspective of their activities during apartheid.</p>
<p>The PAC broke away from the African National Congress in 1959 but never achieved the mass appeal of President Nelson Mandela's party.</p>
<p>Less than two percent of South Africans voted for the PAC in the country's first all-race elections in April 1994.</p>
<p>Police blamed APLA for a series of bloody attacks in the years leading up to the election, including one on a Cape Town church service and others on white social gatherings.</p>
<p>Makwetu said the PAC objected to the format of the truth commission because &quot;our people who were forced to fight a war of liberation are being made to appear on the same platform as their aggressors&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Perpetrators of the apartheid crime against humanity as well as their victims are being equated,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The right-wing Freedom Front made its presentation to the commission on Monday and the National Party, led by former white president F.W. de Klerk, is due to present its submission on Wednesday.</p>
