<p>Argentina hopes its bonds will become the benchmark issues for the Mercosur region, a top Economy Ministry official said Thursday.</p>
<p>Looking into the future development of the Argentine capital markets, Federico Molina, the Economy Ministry's Director of Credit, told Reuters, &quot;We think Argentine bonds will become the benchmark for Mercosur,&quot; the trading bloc that includes Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay.</p>
<p>&quot;This market is going to become important, it is going through an important growth process,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>The market has already grown dramatically in recent years, with some 63 percent of Argentina's total debt raised through bonds at the end of last year compared with just 8.7 percent in 1989, according to a recent United Nations-sponsored study.</p>
<p>As part of its effort to deepen the local credit markets, the Economy Ministry introduced monthly Treasury bill or Letes auctions in April, with some $2.0 billion expected to be sold in 1996. A market maker system for Letes was also introduced, which so far includes 12 foreign and domestic banks.</p>
<p>&quot;The Letes system is working very well,&quot; said Molina.  </p>
<p>He confirmed that in order to build up the local market, maturing overseas debt will gradually be replaced with local debt. Some $81 billion of Argentina's debt was denominated in non-peso instruments and $6.5 billion was in the national currency in 1995, the United Nations sponsored study found.</p>
<p>Still, much of the trade in dollar-denominated bonds like the Bocon and Bonex issues is done in Buenos Aires. Argentina's Brady FRB and par bonds are also traded locally, although a major part of the volume in those instruments is in New York and London.  </p>
<p>Molina did not expand on either the maturities or the timing of the planned new issues of Treasury bonds in the local market announced earlier this year.</p>
<p>But he admitted that &quot;for the moment there isn't a clearly defined yield curve&quot; in the local market. That makes it more cumbersome for overseas funds to invest because they typically invest in paper with different maturities to play spreads to maximise their gains.  </p>
<p>One of the biggest dynamics for the growth of the domestic capital markets is the development of the pension and insurance industries which are &quot;growing quickly,&quot; said Molina. As pension and other funds grow, there will be more domestic capital that can invest in Argentine debt instruments.</p>
<p>Argentine private pension funds were introduced in  August 1994 and currently manage some $4.0 billion in funds for 5.3 million people. The umbrella group for Argentina's pension funds, the Chamber of the Retirement and Pension Fund Administrators (AFJP) estimates there will be some $20 billion in funds managed by 2000.</p>
<p>Neighboring Chile successfully introduced a pension system in the early 1980s, which has ensured that the country has large amounts of capital helping it develop its local markets.</p>
