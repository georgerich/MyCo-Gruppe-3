<title>AUSTRALIA: Australia sees 96/7 A$5.65 bln budget deficit.</title>
<headline>Australia sees 96/7 A$5.65 bln budget deficit.</headline>
<dateline>CANBERRA 1996-08-20</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Australian government said in its budget on Tuesday it expected an underlying deficit in the year ended June 30, 1997 of A$5.65 billion, down from a A$10.32 billion deficit posted in 1995/96.</p>
<p>The median economist forecast was for an underlying deficit number for 1996/97 of A$4.9 billion.</p>
<p>The government said it expected the headline balance, which include asset sale proceeds and early debt repayments, to be in surplus by A$474 million in 1996/97, down from the A$5.05 billion deficit posted in 1995/96.  </p>
<p>Economists had forecast a A$1.0 billion headline surplus for 1996/97.</p>
<p>The government said the starting point underlying deficit for 1996/97 was A$9.56 billion, and that it would take spending and revenue measures which would produce a net reduction in the 1996/97 underlying deficit of A$3.90 billion.</p>
<p>The starting point deficit is the Treasury's estimate of what the budget outcome would be without any policy change.</p>
<p>This estimate is given to the government before the budget is constructed and includes the budget effects of Treasury's latest economic forecasts.  </p>
<p>These deficit reduction measures included planned revenue increases worth A$979 million over the 1996/97 year and planned spending cuts worth A$2.929 billion over the year.</p>
<p>This latest A$9.56 billion starting point compares with the A$7.64 billion starting point for 1996/97 announced on March 12 just after the new government's election.</p>
<p>On July 16 the government announced a A$1.3 billion deterioration in the budget deficit for 1995/96 and Costello said the starting point for 1996/97 would worsen by about that amount.  </p>
<p>The change in the starting point once that A$1.3 billion is taken into account implies economic forecast effects on the budget position of about minus A$660 million.</p>
<p>Economists had a median forecast a A$8.9 billion starting point deficit for 1996/97.</p>
<p>The government said it expected the underlying deficit to fall to A$1.55 billion in 1997/98 and then turn into a surplus of A$957 million in 1998/99.</p>
<p>It said its budget measures announced on Tuesday would reduce the underlying deficit by A$7.15 billion by the end of 1997/98.  </p>
<p>The government said immediately after its election in March that it wanted to make A$8 billion worth of budget cuts over the 1996/97 and 1997/98 years, aiming for balance in 1997/98.</p>
