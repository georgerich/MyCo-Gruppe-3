<p>A surprise rate cut by Taiwan's central bank is likely to boost the island's slow stock market bathed in recent uncertain Taiwan-China relations, securities analysts said on Friday.</p>
<p>Central bank governor Sheu Yuan-dong announced at a hastily arranged news conference that the bank was cutting banks' reserve requirements by up to 0.5 percentage point, effective on Saturday.</p>
<p>The market had been hoping for a rate cut, though analysts said they had not expected it before the central bank's September 12 board meeting.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a surprise, and a good one,&quot; said George Hou, manager at Jardine Fleming.</p>
<p>&quot;We should soon see gains in financial and construction shares. No matter how much the cut will help the economy, the stock market will be benefited first,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Sheu said new reductions in reserve requirements would pump an additional T$25 billion into the island's sluggish economy.</p>
<p>&quot;By releasing the funds, liquidity in the banking system will be loosened. That will lower costs for banks,&quot; Sheu said.</p>
<p>Analysts expected interest to increase in construction firms, now in the sixth year of a severe sectoral recession.</p>
<p>Recovery in the construction industry has been widely expected since the government vowed to speed up public works.</p>
<p>&quot;After banks follow suit to cut rates, which is likely, the money will go into domestic investments or the stock market,&quot; said Benjamin Chen, branch manager of BZW Securities Taiwan.</p>
<p>Taiwan's stock market has been moving narrowly amid concerns over Taiwan-China relations.</p>
<p>China set rules on direct shipping links across the Taiwan Strait earlier this week, boosting investor sentiment.</p>
<p>Taipei, saying Beijing's rules were mingled with political issues, still bans direct shipping links with China and was not expected to move quickly on the proposal.</p>
<p>On Friday, the stock market's weighted index closed up 39.40 points or 0.64 percent at 6,200.22.</p>
<p>Many players were adopting a wait-and-see attitude.</p>
<p>&quot;The important thing is that the central bank promised a loose monetary policy to help the economy. The stock market will be happy to know that the promise is still valid,&quot; said Ben Lee, senior analyst at Normura Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;The economy won't recover immediately, but the rate cut will at least prevent the economy from worsening,&quot; Jardine Fleming's Hou said.</p>
