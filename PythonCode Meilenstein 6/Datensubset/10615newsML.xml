<p>The Zimbabwe dollar was quoted weaker on key currencies in late Friday trade, pressured by continuing importer demand.</p>
<p>But foreign exchange dealers said they expected it to firm in a more stable interbank market next week.</p>
<p>They said they had held a meeting earlier in the day with the central bank which has kept to the sidelines since mid-week as the local unit maintained its slide on the U.S. dollar, sterling and the mark.</p>
<p>&quot;When importers see the dollar depreciate by one percent in one week they want to come in and liquidate their positions and this pressures the rate. There was a bit of panic from importers today but things should stabilise from Monday,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;We had a meeting with the Reserve Bank and clarified a few issues one of them being that the bank believed the market was long but from the dealers' point of view it wasn't,&quot; another one added.</p>
<p>At Friday's close, the Zimbabwe dollar was quoted at 10.1000/1300 on the U.S. unit from its 10.0700/1200 late Thursday position.</p>
<p>On the crosses, it was indicated at 15.6980/7510 on sterling from 15.5800/6660, at 6.7890/8120 on the mark versus 6.7380/7730.</p>
<p>It was also easier on the rand at 2.2220/2310 from 2.2050/2180.</p>
