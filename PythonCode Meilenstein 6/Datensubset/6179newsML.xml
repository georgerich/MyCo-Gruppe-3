<p>News Corp Ltd said on Thursday that the current fiscal year had begun with great promise and a budgeted profit rise of 20 percent for the full year appeared very attainable.  </p>
<p>&quot;From an earnings perspective, the current fiscal year has begun with great promise due to the hit motion picture Indpendence Day, a moderating trend in paper prices and a solid forward book of advertising at the Fox Broadcasting Company (FBC) which will broadcast both the World Series and the Super Bowl,&quot; News said in a statement with its 1995/96 profit result.</p>
<p>&quot;A budgeted profit increase of at least 20 percent for the full year currently appears very attainable,&quot; it said.  </p>
<p>News said strong performances in U.S. television and U.K. newspapers were offset by lower results at Magazines &amp; Inserts and Book Publishing and Star TV.</p>
<p>&quot;Results from Filmed Entertainment and Australian Newspapers remained virtually flat year on year,&quot; News said.</p>
<p>&quot;Throughout the group, higher paper prices increased costs by over US$300 million,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>&quot;In associated companies, solid earnings growth at BSkyB and Australian Newsprint Mills were offset by lower results at Ansett Australia and Queensland Press,&quot; News said.  </p>
<p>&quot;As a result, the total contribution from associated companies declined by seven percent to A$351 million versus A$377 million a year ago.&quot;</p>
<p>News' shares closed up one cent at A$6.47 on Wednesday.</p>
