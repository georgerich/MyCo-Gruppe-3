<p>China has begun merging its rural credit cooperatives into rural banks in a move to tighten management and ease the financial burden of the Agricultural Bank of China, officials said on Friday.</p>
<p>As part of the reform, the Agricultural Bank of China will turn over supervisory responsibility of the cooperatives to the People's Bank of China, or central bank.</p>
<p>An official of the Agricultural Bank told Reuters that preparations for the move were under way, and the change stemmed from a July conference on banking reform in rural areas. That conference was headed by Zhu Rongji, China's chief economic policy maker.</p>
<p>Banking officials in southern Guangdong province told Reuters they have begun the reorganisation as part of the national campaign.</p>
<p>&quot;We have started preparations, it is part of national reform,&quot; an official of the central bank's Guangdong provincial branch said by telephone from Guangzhou, the provincial capital.</p>
<p>Guangdong province would start reorganisations on a trial basis in a few selected counties and cities, the Xinhua news agency said, quoting Zhang Gaoli, Guangdong's Executive Vice-Governor.</p>
<p>All rural credit cooperatives in Guangdong province must sever ties with the Agricultural Bank by mid-1997, Zhang said.</p>
<p>He said the Agricultural Bank would have difficulties administering rural funds in the future because of its drive to become a real commercial bank.</p>
<p>China has tried to turn major state banks, including the Agricultural Bank, into entities operating on commercial principles. It has shifted policy loans, or loans to key sectors that may not be commercially profitable, to special policy banks and away from commercial banks.</p>
<p>China's rural credit cooperatives were allowed to receive deposits form individuals and firms and make loans.</p>
<p>Outstanding deposits of China's rural residents in various financial institutions had reached 703.645 billion yuan by the end of May, official figures showed.</p>
