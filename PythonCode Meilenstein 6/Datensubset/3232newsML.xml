<p>Chechen rebel spokesman Movladi Udugov said on Tuesday that Russian troops blew up a bridge over which refugees were trying to flee the capital, killing about 100 civilians.</p>
<p>&quot;Today around 3.30 p.m. (1130 GMT) several hundred refugees were crossing a bridge near the Kirova settlement towards the village of Alkhan-Yurt,&quot; Udugov told Reuters by telephone.</p>
<p>&quot;When they were crossing the bridge Russian servicemen blew it up. Around 100 refugees, mainly women and children, died.</p>
<p>&quot;Some of the refugees who managed to cross the bridge were seized by the Russian servicemen and shot dead on the spot. Some 6,000 refugees were forced to flee back to Grozny,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Alkhan-Yurt is a few km (miles) southwest of Grozny.</p>
<p>Udugov, whose report could not immediately be confirmed independently, said the Chechen leadership had issued a statement blaming the acting head of troops in Chechnya, Konstantin Pulikovsky.</p>
<p>&quot;It said General Pulikovsky will carry personal responsibility for this before the whole Chechen people no matter how long it takes,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It also appealed to the so-called international community which propagates human rights to find some way to react to this bloody crime and reject this policy of double standards.&quot;</p>
