<p>Supporters of African immigrants fighting expulsion orders on Thursday occupied the headquarters of the Gaullist RPR party, senior partner in France's ruling centre-right coalition, a party spokesman said.</p>
<p>The spokesman told Reuters that the demonstrators were on the upper floors of the building and were shouting slogans.  </p>
<p>One of the demonstrators at the party offices told Reuters by telephone that the protest was called to support some 300 immigrants holed up in a Paris church to fight an expulsion order, 10 of whom are on the 49th day of a hunger strike.</p>
<p>The RPR spokesman said that police were massed outside the offices near the National Assembly and were apparently preparing to intervene.</p>
<p>The government earlier promised to re-examine the expulsion orders but the 10 immigrants kept up their fast, bent on winning more concessions.</p>
<p>The hunger strikers, most of them Malians, have said they would break their fast only when all 300 have won residence permits. They have been drinking sweet tea and taking vitamin pills, but two are said to be in serious condition.</p>
