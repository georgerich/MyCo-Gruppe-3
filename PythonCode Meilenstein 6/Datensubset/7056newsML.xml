<p>French Prime Minister Alain Juppe held talks on Wednesday about a 48-day hunger strike by African immigrants fighting expulsion orders as the government hinted at a more conciliatory line.</p>
<p>The hunger strikers pledged to continue their fast after one of the 10 was taken to hospital on Tuesday night complaining of stomach pains. The hunger strikers are flanked by about 300 other protesters occupying a Paris church.</p>
<p>Juppe, who returned early from his summer holidays on Tuesday, met Xavier Emmanuelli, junior minister for emergency humanitarian action, on Wednesday morning for almost an hour as he took charge of efforts to break the deadlock.</p>
<p>Neither commented on the talks. Supporters of the hunger strikers said Emmanuelli had earlier promised to intervene on their behalf.</p>
<p>Interior Minister Jean-Louis Debre, in a letter to actress Marina Vlady who is supporting the fasters, said he shared her concern at the expulsion of illegal immigrants with children legally in France, and pledged not to separate mothers from their children.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe it is essential that the necessary enforcement of republican law takes the human aspect into consideration,&quot; Debre wrote in the letter released by his office. Its conciliatory tone contrasted with earlier vows to strictly apply the law.</p>
<p>The daily Le Monde said that President Jacques Chirac had asked Juppe to ask France's highest administrative court, the Conseil d'Etat, to review the implementation of French immigration laws as part of a solution to the crisis.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the fasters said that 29-year-old Moussa Keita, taken to hospital on Tuesday, was in no danger.</p>
<p>&quot;He is tired but his condition is not worrying. He has not been put on a drip,&quot; the spokesman told reporters as the Malian rested at the nearby Lariboisiere hospital.</p>
<p>&quot;The fact that one of the hunger strikers was taken to hospital shows that this is a real hunger strike and that they are determined to continue until the end,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Doctors monitoring the health of the hunger strikers at the Saint-Bernard church, where they have been drinking sugared tea and eating vitamins, said two others were in serious condition.</p>
<p>Around the church in the heavily immigrant Goutte d'Or district, protesters including 110 children are surrounded by hundreds of sympathisers committed to preventing police seizing them by chaining themselves together if necessary.</p>
<p>Personalities who have called at the church include Danielle Mitterrand, widow of President Francois Mitterrand, anti-poverty campaigner Abbe Pierre, and sacked bishop Jacques Gaillot. Film star Emanuelle Beart has spent several nights sleeping there.</p>
<p>Short of achieving their main aim, the hunger strikers have managed to divide the ruling centre-right coalition as it struggles to find a way out of the impasse, and to unite the fractious left several weeks into their protest.</p>
<p>&quot;The right is on the verge of a nervous breakdown,&quot; headlined the left-leaning newspaper Liberation.</p>
<p>Left-wing parties, human rights associations and trade unions have called a march from Republique Square in eastern Paris to the church for later in the day (1600 GMT) to show support for the immigrants.</p>
