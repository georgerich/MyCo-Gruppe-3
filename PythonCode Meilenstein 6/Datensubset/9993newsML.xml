<p>China, piling pressure on Taiwan, has offered to hold political talks to end the hostility with the island that it regards as a rebel province.</p>
<p>China's top negotiator with Taipei, Tang Shubei, told a visiting group from Taiwan on Wednesday that it was time for the rivals to hold political talks, Chinese newspapers said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;Now is the time for the two sides to engage in political talks...that is to end the state of hostility,&quot; the overseas edition of the People's Daily quoted Tang as saying.</p>
<p>&quot;China wants peaceful reunification. The two sides have of course to engage in talks. Political disputes should be resolved through political talks,&quot; Tang was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>In Taipei, Kao Koong-lian, spokesman for the cabinet's Mainland Affairs Council, said: &quot;It is fine with us.&quot;</p>
<p>Taiwan says it is committed to reunification but stresses this cannot be achieved overnight.</p>
<p>Taipei has banned official contact, not to mention talks, with Beijing since Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist troops lost the Chinese civil war and fled to the island in 1949.</p>
<p>The two sides have skirted the ban by setting up unofficial bodies to handle bilateral affairs after tensions began easing in the late 1980s.</p>
<p>China suspended unofficial talks with the island last year shortly before Taiwan's President Lee Teng-hui made a landmark visit to the United States.</p>
<p>Beijing has sought to push Taiwan into diplomatic isolation.</p>
<p>China's offer to hold reunification talks came after the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation introduced regulations to pave the way for direct shipping links, which Taiwan still bans.</p>
<p>Taiwan has banned direct air and shipping links with China since 1949 but allows indirect links through Hong Kong or a third country.</p>
<p>Many Taiwanese businessmen, who have poured more than $20 billion into China, clamour for direct transport links, but Taiwan has been reluctant to lift the ban, which it views as its last bargaining chip in talks with the communists.</p>
<p>Chinese Vice-Minister of Foreign Trade Liu Xiangdong urged Taiwanese authorities to &quot;eliminate human barriers (to direct shipping links) as soon as possible&quot;, said the People's Daily, mouthpiece of the Communist Party.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's Beijing-backed Wen Wei Po newspaper quoted a spokesman for the Taiwan Affairs Office of China's cabinet as saying: &quot;There is no reason for the Taiwan authorities to reject the regulations...(which are) pragmatic, flexible and would bring benefits to the two sides.&quot;</p>
<p>On the diplomatic front, China's Foreign Ministry on Wednesday summoned Ukraine's ambassador in Beijing, Anatoly Plyushko, to protest over a visit to Kiev by Taiwan's Vice President Lien Chan, an embassy spokesman said.</p>
<p>The former Soviet republic of Ukraine recognises China but not Taiwan.</p>
<p>In apparent retaliation against Lien's visit, Chinese State Councillor Li Tieying, a member of the powerful Politburo of the ruling Communist Party, has postponed a visit to Ukraine.</p>
<p>Taiwan's state radio reported that Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma met Lien on Wednesday, but a spokesman for Kuchma denied this.</p>
<p>Lien surfaced in Kiev on Tuesday, two days after vanishing on a mysterious European mission. He made a secret detour to Ukraine to receive an honorary degree after making a state visit to the Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>Lien and Kuchma have reached agreement to exchange representative offices, Taiwan's Central Daily News said.</p>
