<title>BELGIUM: Fourth person charged in Belgian child sex scandal.</title>

<p>A Belgian court formally charged a fourth person on Tuesday in a major child sex scandal in which two eight-year-old girls have died and at least four others were abducted.</p>
<p>Officials said the court decided to keep Brussels businessman Jean-Michel Nihoul, detained on charges of criminal association, in jail.</p>
<p>Convicted paedophile Marc Dutroux and associate Michel Lelievre were formally charged last Friday with abduction and illegal imprisonment after police rescued two young girls from a house owned by Dutroux in the southern town of Charleroi.</p>
<p>Dutroux led police on Saturday to the buried bodies of Julie Lejeune and Melissa Russo who died of starvation early this year after being kidnapped in June 1995.</p>
<p>Dutroux's wife Michelle Martin was charged on Monday with being an accomplice in the abduction and imprisonment of children.</p>
<p>Nihoul's lawyer, Clement de Clety, earlier told reporters that Nihoul knew Lelievre and Dutroux.</p>
<p>&quot;(Nihoul) just gave (them) his car for two or three days to repair it and to pass it on to the technical control authorities. These are the only concrete points in the file, nothing more,&quot; de Clety said.</p>
<p>Belgian media said earlier on Tuesday that the Dutch boyfriend of Nihoul's ex-wife had also been arrested, but court sources said the charges against him had been dropped and that he had only been questioned.</p>
