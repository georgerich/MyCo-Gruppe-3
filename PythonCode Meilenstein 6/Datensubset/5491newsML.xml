<p>Foreign investors, given broader access to the Russian Treasury bill market for the first time on Wednesday, made a cautious start with bids of about $100 million for three- and six- month paper.</p>
<p>Non-residents were allowed to bid for more than three trillion roubles (about $600 million) worth of bills under the terms of two auctions, held under the new scheme.</p>
<p>A central bank official said non-residents bid 500 billion roubles. The two issues were for a total of 11.50 trillion roubles and bids for both were a combined 16.23 trillion.</p>
<p>Access to the market was widened a week ago but the reasons for the slow start appeared to be technical rather than concern at the relatively low yield on offer.</p>
<p>One reason is that Russian banks are not yet ready for the scheme and another is that potential investors are not fully informed about the details, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Most Russian banks authorised to work in this scheme are not yet ready to provide their clients with comprehensive information,&quot; said one.</p>
<p>The central bank allowed non-residents to open special rouble accounts at selected Russian banks from August 15.</p>
<p>They can use funds on these accounts to buy and sell GKO discount Treasury bills and OFZ interest-bearing government bonds at auction and in the secondary market.</p>
<p>There is no limit on the amount which can be repatriated from these accounts but purchases of foreign currency must be made through forward deals or options with a term of at least three months, at rates influenced by the central bank, effectively limiting the dollar yield on T-bills to 19 percent.</p>
<p>The average yield on Wednesday's issue of four trillion roubles of three-month bills was 63.18 percent and the yield on an auction of 7.50 trillion roubles of six-month paper was 74.16 percent, both falling slightly from the last auction a week ago.</p>
<p>&quot;The results of today's auctions are a positive indicator for the Finance Ministry and central bank in that they show domestic investors are still strong. The auctions were held under one banner -- holding or lowering the market yield,&quot; said Denis Nechayev of MFK bank.</p>
<p>Yields skyrocketed to more than 200 percent in the run-up to Boris Yeltsin's presidential election victory in July. the government has been keen to lower its borrowing costs and this was one reason for broadening access to foreigners.</p>
<p>However, some analysts have said that foreigners interested in investing in T-bills have already found ways into the market at far higher yields.</p>
<p>Restrictions under the old system have led Russian banks to set up semi-legal &quot;grey&quot; schemes, in which foreign investors lend hard currency to a Russian bank, which invests the money in T-bills, sharing the high domestic return with the foreigner.</p>
<p>In line with its policy of lowering yields, the government did not take up any fresh money in the auctions, just rolling over maturing debt.</p>
<p>Combined proceeds were seven trillion roubles, close to the sum the finance ministry repaid on maturing six-month bills.</p>
<p>Sergei Koshlenko of CS First Boston said the six-month issue attracted particular attention.</p>
<p>&quot;The market will be strong tomorrow. Non-resident demand was good and there is great potential interest in these instruments from non-residents. ($ = 5,305 roubles)</p>
