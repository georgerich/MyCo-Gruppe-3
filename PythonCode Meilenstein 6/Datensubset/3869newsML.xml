<p>after Monday's sharp fall</p>

<p>**  Last day of weekly account on National Stock Exchange</p>
<p>(NSE) triggers short-covering</p>
<p>**  The benchmark Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) index rises</p>
<p>1.05 percent at close after plunging 2.99 percent on</p>
<p>Monday</p>
<p>**  The NSE index inches up 0.38 percent</p>
<p>------</p>
<p>Buying by domestic institutional funds helped Indian shares recover on Tuesday but the undercurrent was shaky after Monday's sharp fall, brokers said.</p>
<p>The 30-share BSE index rose 34.57 points, or 1.05 percent, to 3,316.06 after plunging 101.26 points on Monday.</p>
<p>The 50-stock NSE index gained 1.0 point at 977 with the net traded value at 10.35 billion rupees in 53.04 million shares.</p>
<p>The 500-share CRISIL index gained 0.61 points to 666.83.</p>
<p>But the 200-share CRISIL midcap index was down 5.56 points at 471.72.  </p>
<p>&quot;It was a combination of local fund buying and short covering,&quot; one trader said, referring to the gains. &quot;We'll have to wait till tomorrow to see where the market is headed.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the close of weekly account on the NSE eased speculative selling pressure and forced short covering.</p>
<p>Traders said foreign institutional investors (FIIs) continued to sell shares of bank firm SBI which plans to issue global depositary receipts (GDRs) for up to $500 million.</p>
<p>&quot;The GDRs are priced on the basis of the underlying stock on the BSE,&quot; one trader said. &quot;The FIIs stand to benefit if they can pick up the GDRs cheaply.&quot;  </p>
<p>However, SBI stock ended 2.25 rupees higher at 266.25 helped by reports it would benefit by 2.0 billion rupees in excess depreciation on government securities in 1995/96 (April-March).</p>
<p>Local fund buying helped TISCO gain 3.25 rupees at 183.75, TELCO 10.0 at 465 and BSES 3.50 at 180.50.</p>
<p>Bajaj Auto rallied 17.50 rupees to 990, Hindalco 12.0 to 950, Indian Hotels 9.50 to 767.50, Ranbaxy 8.50 to 608.75, Hind Lever 8.0 to 826.75, Reliance 6.0 to 201 and ITC 4.0 to 286.</p>
<p>The Delhi share index gained 7.07 points to 773.86 and the Calcutta index was up 1.82 points at 441.53. The Madras index finished 22.98 points lower at 3,528.91.</p>
