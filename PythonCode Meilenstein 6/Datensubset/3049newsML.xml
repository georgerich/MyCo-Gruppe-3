<headline>European vegetable oils close mostly higher.</headline>

<p>Closing European vegetable oil prices on Tuesday were higher in slow directionless trading.</p>
<p>&quot;The market isn't in the doldrums, but people don't know where it is going next and while the situation lasts, more players will drop out until business picks up again,&quot; said a trader.</p>
<p>Palm oil prices were higher following the steadier close in Malaysia after the release of market-friendly export data by a local cargo surveyor.</p>
<p>Data issued by Malaysian cargo surveyor Societe Generale de Surveillance (SGS) put local exports between Aug 1-20 at 398,288 tonnes against 391,644 tonnes during the same period in July.</p>
<p>Asian traders said the SGS figures seemed to indicate that exports will remain high during the rest of August.</p>
<p>However, European traders were inclined to remain cautious owing to the high palm oil production levels and the lack of any substantial Chinese buying.</p>
<p>Crude palm oil cif Europe closed $10 up after Sep traded at $507.50 a tonne cif.</p>
<p>Products were around $10 higher with no further business reported.</p>
<p>Coconut oil closed unchanged to $20 after Jul/Aug traded at $777.50 and Aug/Sep at $735 a tonne cif while palmkernel oil was $5 higher and tradeless.</p>
<p>Soft oils finished with soy oil 1.50 to 0.50 guilders up after Oct traded at 94.50 and Nov/Jan at 96.75 guilders a 100 kg fob ex-mill.</p>
<p>Dutch/EU rape oil closed 1.50 guilders higher after Oct traded at 94.50 guilders.</p>
