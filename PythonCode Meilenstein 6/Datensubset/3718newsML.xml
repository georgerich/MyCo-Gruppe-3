<p>U.S. West Coast crude prices turned mixed in late morning trade, with lights falling ahead of the September crude expiry and heavies rising on higher posted prices.</p>
<p>Most major oil companies increased their California posted crude prices prices by 50 cents late Monday, in line with the recent rally in futures.</p>
<p>The increase in postings lifted Kern River to $13.90/14.40 a barrel, versus $13.50/14.00 the previous day. Differentials were seen unchanged.</p>
<p>Wilmington also rose with postings to $15.90/16.00.  </p>
<p>But outright prices for lights came under pressure from spot WTI trade, which turned lower in New York midsession trade ahead of the futures contract expiry today.</p>
<p>Alaska North Slope (ANS) fell 20 cents to $20.80/21.10.</p>
<p>But ANS differentials were unchanged, with most refiners claiming they were adequately supplied or waiting to see Canadian prices before buying incremental crude for September.</p>
<p>However, one major refinery bought at $1.95 a barrel under September WTI Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;I thought they would be able to do wider,&quot; another refiner said, referring to the 10-cent fall in ANS deltas since August.</p>
<p>Prices for Line 63 also tracked the fall in WTI values, with no spot deals done in recent weeks and supply and demand seen balanced in the thinly traded market.</p>
<p>Pre-nominations for Line 63 shipments will begin late Tuesday, with restrictions announced with two days.</p>
