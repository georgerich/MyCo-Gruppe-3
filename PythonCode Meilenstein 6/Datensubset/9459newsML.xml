<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, apparently shaken by reports Cairo might have cold feet on holding an upcoming Middle East economic summit, told Egypt's president that talks with the PLO would resume soon.</p>
<p>&quot;The prime minister informed President Mubarak about the track which is planned in the talks with the Palestinians which are to be opened in the very near future including via the steering committee,&quot; Netanyahu's office said in a statement issued to the media on Thursday.  </p>
<p>Earlier on Thursday Mubarak, speaking to academics in the Egyptian city of Alexandria, said the world could not keep waiting for the right-wing Israeli government to make up its mind about its next step in the peace process.</p>
<p>&quot;For the past two months they've been saying we're committed to our obligations, but when? The Palestinians and the world are not going to wait 10 months or a year.</p>
<p>&quot;We have an economic conference coming up and I've told the Israelis that no progress in the peace process will hit the Middle East economic summit because not many countries will attend. That's what we're worried about,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Israeli government has not yet taken a decision on redeploying troops in the West Bank town of Hebron, an operation that should have taken place in March. The economic conference is to be held in November.</p>
