<p>Thousands of British troops with hundreds of armoured vehicles will pour across NATO's eastern border into Poland this month for a pioneering exercise that may lead other Western armies to hire Polish training grounds.</p>
<p>British Brigadier David Montgomery said on Wednesday that his 7th Armoured Brigade would bring almost 3,500 personnel and 440 armoured vehicles, including Challenger 1 tanks, from bases in Germany for the August 30 to September 20 exercise.</p>
<p>Britain has hired the 400 square km (154.5 sq mile) Drawsko area in the northeast, largest of several Polish post-Warsaw Pact training grounds, for Ulan Eagle '96.</p>
<p>The British plan to return in 1997, while Polish officials say they will reinvest earnings to improve facilities.</p>
<p>&quot;I would expect to have a brigade back here every year -- and this brigade every three years -- if things go as planned,&quot; Montgomery told a news conference in Warsaw.</p>
<p>The vast Polish areas where Soviet armies trained before the 1989 fall of communism offer ideal conditions, without many of the constraints imposed by British and German civilian concern over noise. They are also relatively cheap.</p>
<p>Montgomery said the exercise, which will not use live ammunition, would cost about 3.5 million sterling ($5.5 million) above the budget of his brigade, called the &quot;Desert Rats&quot; since the World War Two African campaigns of his distant relative Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery.</p>
<p>An exercise in its training facility in Alberta, western Canada, using live rounds but involving only 1,200 troops, would cost 5.5 million sterling ($8.5 million) because of transport and other expenses.</p>
<p>Neither side in the deal, sealed by British Defence Minister Michael Portillo in Warsaw in June, will reveal how much Britain is paying Poland.</p>
<p>Polish Defence Ministry spokesman Eugeniusz Mleczak said this was a commercial secret as Poland was in talks with other interested armies.</p>
<p>Montgomery said Drawsko's terrain which was wooded, hilly and wet like much of Europe, unlike the much vaster Canadian ground which has only seven trees, or the smaller, heavily-booked German grounds which also lack forests.</p>
<p>Drawsko offers a first chance since the Gulf War for a British armoured brigade to train almost as a whole.</p>
<p>The exercise, simulating full-scale combat rather than peacekeeping, is purely British, although Polish forces are invited to observe closely and engineers will build a bridge.</p>
<p>But Mleczak said it would serve Poland's military and political progress towards joining NATO.</p>
<p>This goal is opposed by Russia, the heavily militarised Kaliningrad enclave of which borders Poland.</p>
<p>Portillo, accompanied by the Polish and Ukrainian defence ministers, is to visit the exercise on September 3.</p>
<p>The British and Polish governments have signed a detailed understanding on financial, legal, disciplinary, environmental and other issues and Poland's parliament is working on longer-term provisions for such exercises, Mleczak said.</p>
<p>While the tanks will come by train, almost 700 non-armoured vehicles are to travel the 600 kms (400 miles) to Drawsko by road, the first major British army crossing of the former East Germany.</p>
<p>This will be on a German holiday weekend, passing 36 road works on the way. &quot;They are predicting the biggest traffic jam this century,&quot; Montgomery said.</p>
