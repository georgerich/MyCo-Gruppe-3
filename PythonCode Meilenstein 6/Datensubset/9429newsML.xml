<p>China's state media celebrated paramount leader Deng Xiaoping's 92nd birthday on Thursday with praise, poetry and propaganda, but the ageing patriarch remained as reclusive as ever.</p>
<p>Officials declined to say where Deng, whose health is reported to be frail, would spend his birthday, but said the diminutive leader was in good shape for a man of his age.</p>
<p>State newspapers made no direct mention of the passing of the latest milestone in Deng's political life, but articles lauding him heralded the start of the reformer's 93rd year.</p>
<p>&quot;Deng Xiaoping is both the architect of our nation's modernisation and reform and also a veritable great strategist,&quot; said the Liberation Army Daily, the mouthpiece of Deng's military powerbase.</p>
<p>The People's Daily, voice of China's communist leadership, eulogised the gravel-voiced former chain-smoker as a master diplomat and weighty communist philosopher.</p>
<p>&quot;Materialist dialectics are the philosophical basis of Deng Xiaoping's construction of the theory of Socialism with Chinese Characteristics,&quot; the newspaper said.</p>
<p>&quot;Deng's extensive and profound diplomatic thoughts, which greatly enriched and perfected China's independent foreign policy of peace, has led China to achieve one success after another in its diplomacy,&quot; it said in a separate article.</p>
<p>Chinese analysts say Deng's influence has declined along with his health, but the man who sent China down the road of market-style reform continues to influence his appointed successors.</p>
<p>The success of Deng's reforms in bringing unprecedented wealth to many Chinese ensures that his theories are frequently cited even by those who wish to alter economic policies established during his ascendancy.</p>
<p>Rumours of his impending death still provoke ripples of alarm on China's nascent stock markets.</p>
<p>Officials have long declined to give details of the state of the old revolutionary's health, deflecting inquiries with a standard: &quot;He is in good health for a man of his age.&quot;</p>
<p>Deng has not been seen in public for more than two years and the most recent photograph of him was issued in January 1995 -- a fuzzy image that did little to quash rumours he was seriously ill.</p>
<p>The Beijing Youth Daily splashed a recent snapshot of a healthy-looking Deng across its front page on Thursday -- but the picture showed a newly-completed waxwork and not the ageing leader himself.</p>
<p>Deng is reported to detest the kind of personality cult that marked the rule of late Chairman Mao Zedong, but his declining years have been marked by an increasingly adulatory approach to him by state propagandists.</p>
<p>The Xinhua news agency said one beneficiary of Deng's abandonment of Mao's strict social controls and Stalinist economic approach had honoured his hero with a 3,000-line poem called &quot;The Ode to Deng Xiaoping&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The politically inspired lyric poem illustrates the course that Deng has pursued for more than 90 years, and (the) opportunities, prosperity, and glory his thought has brought about in China,&quot; the official agency said.</p>
<p>&quot;Without Deng, my generation and I would not have what we have today,&quot; it quoted author Gui Xinghua, a member of China's once-persecuted class of intellectuals as saying.</p>
<p>The official praise did not move all readers of Beijing's state media, however.</p>
<p>After scanning the Liberation Daily's long tribute to Deng's strategic thinking, one young Beijing reader said the article said little that was new.</p>
<p>&quot;They could just use chunks of this for his obituary, when he dies,&quot; she said.</p>
