<p>A key panel of California state lawmakers has backed a proposal to change local property tax allocations to benefit the state's cash-strapped local governments, officials said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Legislation, authored by state Senator William Craven, a Republican from Oceanside, would allow California counties, cities and special districts to retain certain funds that would otherwise be shifted to schools and community colleges.</p>
<p>Lawmakers on a legislative conference committee agreed to back the legislation and have now sent it to the Senate and Assembly for approval, Scott Johnson, counsel to Craven, said.  </p>
<p>The legislation was supported by the California State Association of Counties and several California cities.</p>
<p>To implement the 1992-1993 and 1993-1994 state budgets, the state Legislature shifted $3.6 billion in property tax revenues from local governments to schools by creating an Educational Revenue Augmentation Fund (ERAF) in each county.</p>
<p>Counties, cities, special districts and redevelopment agencies shift funds to ERAF to reduce the state's funding obligations to school districts and community colleges. County auditors allocate ERAF balances, including the growth in property tax revenues, to the schools and colleges.  </p>
<p>Local officials have long objected to their annual property tax shifts, arguing it deprives them of discretionary revenues that could fund development and local programs.</p>
<p>Under Craven's proposal, the growth attributable to ERAF shifts would be retained by counties, cities and special districts. Local governments in the state would retain about $150 million in 1997-1998 under the legislation.</p>
<p>&quot;It's time to assist the counties,&quot; Johnson said.</p>
<p>He added that California schools and community colleges would not be hurt under the proposed legislation because the state would offset the lost revenues.  </p>
<p>The California State Association of Counties strongly supported the measure, Dan Wall, a lobbyist for the group, said. &quot;I think it's a responsible first step,&quot; Wall said.</p>
<p>Of the $3.6 billion shifted from local governments to the state in 1992-1993 and 1993-1994, counties lost an estimated $2.6 billion, Wall said.</p>
<p>&quot;Ultimately, we wish to get that money back, but we have to recognize the fiscal realities for the state,&quot; Wall said.</p>
