<headline>Russian MinFins up but bond freezing worries stay.</headline>
<dateline>MOSCOW 1996-08-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>Prices of Russian MinFin bonds firmed on Thursday, helped by a denial more bonds could be frozen, peace talks in Chechnya, President Boris Yeltsin's appearance on television and payment of a new tranche of the International Monetary Fund loan.</p>
<p>		 tranche  Aug 22		  Aug 21</p>
<p> 1999 maturity (3)    75.70-76.00	   74.90-75.20</p>
<p> 2003 maturity (4)    48.65-48.95	   47.80-48.10</p>
<p> 2008 maturity (5)    32.30-32.60	   31.20-31.50</p>
<p> 2006 maturity (6)    37.25-38.00	   37.00-37.30</p>
<p> 2011 maturity (7)    28.00-28.25	   27.30-27.60</p>
<p>&quot;The market is firmer today largely because participants are more relaxed about the rumours on new frozen bonds,&quot; a Moscow Narodny Bank dealer said.</p>
<p>MinFin bond prices fell on Wednesday mainly on rumours some banks had had some of their bonds frozen. But a finance ministry official who declined to be named told Reuters that no new bonds had been frozen.</p>
<p>&quot;The day is less nervous, but yesterday's rumours are still keeping many Russian and some London operators out of the market as such things can outweigh any good news,&quot; a Russian bank dealer said.</p>
<p>MinFin bond prices were hit in June when the finance ministry said it would not service stolen bonds totalling $24.22 million, part of which were stolen in breakaway Chechnya.</p>
<p>The dealer also noted buying by a London operator that helped boost prices.</p>
<p>&quot;The fact that Yeltsin is back in Moscow... and hopes that the conflict in Chechnya is being resolved are also positive for the market. The IMF tranche also has a good effect,&quot; the Moscow Narodny Bank dealer said.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the IMF released the July tranche of a $10 billion loan, which had been withheld because of Fund concerns about the impact on fiscal policy of poor tax collection.</p>
