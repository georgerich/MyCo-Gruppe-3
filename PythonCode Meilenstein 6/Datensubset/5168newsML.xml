<p>Blue-chip stocks dropped Wednesday, ending a three-session winning streak as investors took profits and tobacco stocks took a beating.</p>
<p>Bonds also dropped. The dollar fell against the German mark but climbed against the Japanese yen, and crrude oil prices moved lower.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 31.44 points at 5,689.82 after gaining 56 points from Friday to Tuesday.</p>
<p>In the broader market, declining issues led advances 1,225 to 1,048 on moderate volume of 348 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>&quot;We had basic profit-taking in stocks,&quot; said Peter Cardillo, director of research of Westfalia Investments.</p>
<p>Analysts said stock in Philip Morris and other tobacco companies were hit by mouting lawsuits and signs of increased government oversight.</p>
<p>&quot;Philip Morris is accounting for the cloud over the market,&quot; said Alan Ackerman, a market strategist at Fahnestock &amp; Co.</p>
<p>Michigan Wednesday became the 13th state to sue the tobacco industry to recover health-care costs, a day after Arizona and Kansas sued. In Indianapolis, a crucial trial over cigarettes was nearing its conclusion.</p>
<p>In another development, the White House said President Clinton was expected to announce Friday that he accepts a Food and Drug Administration recommendation that tobacco be regulated as a drug.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems to be one problem after another. It's a negative for Philip Morris and other tobacco stocks but I don't think it'll affect the rest of the market,&quot; said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp.</p>
<p>Ackerman said, &quot;There's no telling how investors will value tobacco stocks from here on in. It's certainly not an area where an investor can jump in.&quot;</p>
<p>Wall Street was still mindful of the stiff selling in tobacco stocks in the wake of an Aug. 9 Florida jury ruling against the industry in a lawsuit filed by a smoker.</p>
<p>Analysts said trading remained seasonally slow.</p>
<p>&quot;We're operating in a vacuum. The only thing to stimulate stocks is bonds,&quot; said Larry Wachtel, a Prudential Securities market analyst. &quot;There's not much volume, not many players and not much conviction.&quot;</p>
<p>In the bond market, the Treasury's key 30-year bond lost 15/32, or $4.688 on a $1,000 bond, and its yield rose to 6.84 percent from 6.80 percent at Tuesday's close.</p>
<p>In currency markets, the dollar dropped against the mark after new German economic data dimmed hopes for a cut in German interest rates. But the U.S. currency climbed against the yen as a Japanese finance company's bankruptcy hinted at continued low interest rates in Japan.</p>
<p>A reduction of German short-term interest rates would probably boost the dollar by making bank deposits denominated in U.S. currency more attractive.</p>
<p>In late New York trading, the dollar settled at 1.4825 marks, down from 1.4883 Tuesday. The dollar rose to 108.45 yen from 108.35 yen after consumer finance firm Minami Kyushu Credit Co. Ltd. said it filed for bankruptcy.</p>
<p>In commodities markets, crude oil prices moved lower after government and industry reports showed inventories increased this past week.</p>
<p>NYMEX crude oil for October delivery closed down 39 cents at $21.72 per barrel. September heating oil closed down 0.69 cent at 60.98 cents per gallon and September gasoline was down 0.89 cent at 63.12 cents per gallon.</p>
<p>In overseas markets, stocks in Tokyo rose on relief that the Federal Reserve's decision Tuesday to leave interest rates unchanged, with the 225-share Nikkei average climbing 148.01 points, or 0.70 percent percent to 21,275.02. The London Stock Exchange's FTSE 100 index dropped 11.1 points to 3,827.1.</p>
