<headline>EMERGENCY WEATHER CONDITIONS -  WSC - 22-AUG.</headline>
<text>
<p>The center of Typhoon Niki has moved westward across southern Hainan, China, and is now in the Gulf of Tonkin. Niki produced very heavy rain and damaging winds on Hainan, and is expected to bring similar conditions to northern Vietnam. Landfall on the upper coast of Vietnam is expected within 12 hours. Top winds, now near 95 mph, should remain near 90 mph at the time of landfall. Niki will also be a major threat to shipping from Hainan through the Gulf of Tonkin to Vietnam during this period. Once Niki moves inland, it will rapidly weaken but heavy rainfall will likely produce flooding  </p>
<p>Tropical Storm Dolly is centered about 300 miles east-southeast of Tampico, over water in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico. Top winds have increased to 50 mph and further strengthening will continue during today as Dolly continues to track west northwestward about 11 to 13 mph. Dolly will be a threat to shipping, then the threat to land will increase as the storm heads for the upper coast of eastern Mexico. Landfall is expected near midday Friday on the coast near Tampico, Mexico. Winds should be between 75 and 85 mph at the time of landfall.  </p>
<p>Tropical Storm Edouard is in the open Atlantic about 645 miles west of the Cape Verde Islands, moving west at 13 mph. It has top winds of 45 mph and is expected to strengthen while tracking to the west or west northwest over the next 24 hours. The threat from Edouard is only to shipping at this time.</p>
<p>Tropical Depression 19W, in the western Pacific northwest of the Mariana Islands, is drifting to the north and is expected to continue this motion during the next 36 hours. Top winds, now 35 mph, may reach 45 mph as the system becomes a tropical storm during this period. The threat to shipping is moderate.</p>
