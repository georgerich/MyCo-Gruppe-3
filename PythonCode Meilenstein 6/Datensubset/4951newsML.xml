<p>Nickel giant Inco Ltd., after besting suitors and facing down legal challenges, said said on Wednesday that it has finally closed its C$4.3 billion ($3.2 billion) takeover of Diamond Fields Resources Inc.</p>
<p>The closing gives Inco, already one of the world's biggest nickel miners, a leading role in the nickel market for years to come with the acquisition of the massive copper-cobalt-nickel deposit in remote Voisey's Bay, Labrador, in northeastern Canada.</p>
<p>Diamond Fields shareholders had the choice to take common shares in Inco, cash up to a maximum of C$350 million ($256 million), preferred shares in Inco or a new class of VBN shares to participate directly in the Voisey's Bay deposit.</p>
<p>Inco said Wednesday the full C$350 million was paid out. The company also distributed a total of 50.3 million common shares, 25.9 million Inco class VBN shares and 9.4 million preferred shares as part of the acquisition.</p>
<p>The deal ends a long takeover battle and legal saga. Inco's bid beat out rival Toronto-based Falconbridge Ltd. last spring.</p>
<p>But Inco refused to sign the dotted line when, days before the scheduled closing of the deal, a group of Texans launched a lawsuit against Diamond Fields executives and Inco.</p>
<p>The lawsuit was settled Aug. 5, clearing the way for the deal to go through.</p>
<p>For Inco, the deal was worth fighting for. The Voisey's Bay deposit is thought to be one of the largest metals discoveries in the world.</p>
<p>The site contains an estimated reserve of about 150 million metric tons of ore and will give Inco a solid chunk of the nickel market when production starts up in 1998 or 1999.</p>
<p>The low-cost, high-quality Voisey's Bay project is expected to produce one-third of all new nickel mine output in the next 10 years and force some high-cost nickel projects out of business, analysts have said.</p>
<p>Inco may still face some roadblocks before it gets to that stage, however.</p>
<p>The nickel giant must negotiate with local native groups and win environmental approvals before it can go ahead with production.</p>
