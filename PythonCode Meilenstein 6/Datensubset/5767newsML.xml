<p>American researchers said on Wednesday they had invented an artificial nose that literally lights up to identify different smells. Todd Dickinson, a chemist, and colleagues at Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts said their entirely new approach to detecting odours could be used in a variety of applications, from hospitals to pollution monitoring.</p>
<p>The &quot;nose&quot; uses bundles of optical fibres coated with slightly different solutions of plastic and dye. The plastics have varying properties which cause them to react to different vapours, or smells, in characteristic ways.</p>
<p>The researchers shone light through the optical fibres while exposing the bundles to different vapours.</p>
<p>The way the polymer and dye mixtures reacted to the vapours changed the light signal, and the researchers could then measure and categorise the change caused by different smells.</p>
<p>&quot;The system is able to identify individual vapours at different concentrations with great accuracy,&quot; they wrote in the scientific journal Nature.</p>
<p>&quot;For example, in response to a two-second pulse of benzene vapour, some fibres exhibited a large, rapid decrease in fluorescence while others showed smaller, more gradual decreases.&quot;</p>
<p>They added: &quot;&quot;Artificial noses' such as this should have wide potential application, most notably in environment and medical monitoring.&quot;</p>
<p>But they said the system had pure scientific applications, too. &quot;It is possible that further investigation of the &quot;artificial' nose may provide insight into the functioning of the &quot;real' nose,&quot; they wrote.</p>
<p>So far the system can only pick out nine different odours, including benzene and different alcohols, Dickinson said. But he said it would be expanded to react to many more.</p>
<p>&quot;What we are really trying to emphasise is that this is a new approach,&quot; he said. &quot;This is certainly not commercialised yet.&quot;</p>
