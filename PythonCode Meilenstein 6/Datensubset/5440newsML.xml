<title>RUSSIA: PRESS DIGEST - RUSSIA - AUG 21.</title>
<headline>PRESS DIGEST - RUSSIA - AUG 21.</headline>
<text>
<p>IZVESTIA</p>
<p>- The Russian military is determined to drive rebel fighters out of the Chechen capital Grozny. The only difference in the opinions among the military is whether to bomb the city immediately or take some time for thorough preparations.</p>
<p>- President Yeltsin has given security chief Alexander Lebed an impossible task -- to restore order in Grozny. It could be used as a pretext to remove the stubborn general from the political scene.</p>
<p>SEVODNYA</p>
<p>- The deepening crisis in Grozny may turn into a catastrophe for Russian state authorities. They seem to be losing control over the military.</p>
<p>-President Yeltsin could have easily stopped all rumours about his health simply by flying back to Moscow and showing himself in public, the paper said.</p>
<p>NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA</p>
<p>- The pro-Moscow Chechen leader Doku Zavgayev promised to do all in his power to make General Pulikovsky to withdraw the ultimatum.</p>
<p>ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA</p>
<p>- Grozny now is like a clock bomb which may explode in 24 hours if General Pulikovsky keeps his word on an ultimatum and rebel fighters ignore it.</p>
<p>PRAVDA</p>
<p>- Recent developments in the banking sphere may lead to a financial crisis in the nearest future, the paper's expert says.</p>
<p>MOSKOVSKY KOMSOMOLETS</p>
<p>- I do not rule out that under certain circumstances such attempts ( of a new coup d'etat) are possible although very unlikely. In any case their results would be the same if not more deplorable than in August 1991, said Russian president Boris Yeltsin looking back at the attempted putsch of 1991 in the interview to the paper.</p>
