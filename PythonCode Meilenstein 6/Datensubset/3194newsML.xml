<p>Terrified civilians flooded out of the Chechen capital on Tuesday after a top Russian military official threatened to use planes and heavy artillery to drive separatist forces from the city.</p>
<p>The refugees, many of them with little more than the clothes in which they stood, said Russian planes had started bombing the town, much of it already in ruins after attacks at the start of Russia's campaign to crush Chechnya's independence bid.</p>
<p>&quot;The whole city is on its way out,&quot; said Nina Madayeva, who said 12 planes had bombed Grozny's southwestern Chernorechye district overnight. &quot;We've been in a basement for 14 or 15 days and couldn't stand it any more.&quot;</p>
<p>Konstantin Pulikovsky, Russia's acting commander in Chechnya, said his forces had begun artillery attacks on rebels in Grozny and would bomb the city if needed to drive them out. But he denied that bombing had already started.</p>
<p>Pulikovsky, who signed a ceasefire order on Saturday, accused the guerrillas of using the truce to dig in in the regional capital, much of which they seized two weeks ago.</p>
<p>&quot;I see force as the only way out of the situation in Grozny,&quot; he told Interfax news agency.</p>
<p>Rebel chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov appealed to Kremlin security chief Alexander Lebed, who has held talks with the rebels and opposed the use of aircraft, to rein in Pulikovsky's troops.</p>
<p>President Boris Yeltsin's special envoy in Chechnya should &quot;use all of his influence to stop the approaching madness&quot;, Interfax quoted Maskhadov as saying.</p>
<p>Itar-Tass news agency said Lebed would travel to Chechnya on Wednesday -- his third visit to the region in just over a week. Tass said Lebed remained committed to a peaceful solution to the Chechen conflict.</p>
<p>The rebels, who seek independence for their territory, swept into Grozny on August 6, seizing key buildings and trapping Russian soldiers in their checkpoints and in the central government complex.</p>
<p>Pulikovsky, who on Monday gave civilians 48 hours to leave before he unleashes an all-out bombardment, said on Tuesday he was determined to drive the rebels out.</p>
<p>Doku Zavgayev, who heads the Moscow-backed administration in Chechnya, told a news conference that 50,000 people had fled Grozny in the last two weeks, but he believed 300,000 were still living in the city.</p>
<p>&quot;As long as there are so many civilians in the town the use of force, let alone a full-scale operation, is totally unacceptable,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Zavgayev and his administration colleagues, viewed as stooges by the separatists, have spoken out frequently against Russian military action in recent months, although its own security depends on the troops which moved into Chechnya in December 1994.</p>
<p>Pulikovsky's views are in sharp contrast with those of Lebed, who won guarded approval from rebel leaders in two visits to Chechnya last week. His spokesman told Tass on Monday, before the army threat, that Lebed opposed bombing.</p>
<p>&quot;Aerial bombardment as a military method of settling the problem, even with the evacuation of civilians, will lead only to widening the conflict zone,&quot; the spokesman, Alexander Barkhatov, quoted Lebed as saying.</p>
<p>Pulikovsky, who met Maskhadov twice last week to arrange the latest truce, said he was sure of the backing of Russia's leaders. He said he was acting &quot;in the interests of the state&quot;.</p>
<p>The Kremlin and the army have sounded different notes on Chechnya in the past. Yeltsin, trying to end the war before the presidential election in July, ordered a halt to an offensive in March, but the generals continued bombarding Chechen villages.</p>
<p>Yeltsin won a lull with a ceasefire in May, but shortly after his re-election the army went on the offensive again and the rebels say that this provoked their raid on Grozny.</p>
