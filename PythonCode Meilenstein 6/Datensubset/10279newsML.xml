<p>Zimbabwe shares rose to a record high on Friday because of lower interest rates and improved inflation prospects, traders said.</p>
<p>The market ignored a continuing strike by thousands of civil servants and the key 57-share index rose 95.85 points, or 1.7 percent, to close at a record 5,675.17.</p>
<p>&quot;The market was bullish in keeping with expectations in an environment where inflation and interest rates are coming down,&quot; one broker said.</p>
<p>A market official and share analysts forecast the market will rise further in the next few months as interest rates fall following a central bank cut in a key lending rate.</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) said on Thursday it had lowered its rediscount rate to 27.5 percent from 29.5 percent with effect from Tuesday, citing a fall in annual inflation.</p>
<p>It last brought down the rate in November 1994 when it eased it to 29.5 percent from 30 percent but had since maintained a tight monetary policy to fight resurgent annual inflation -- pegged at 22 percent in July from 28 percent in January.</p>
<p>&quot;It's welcome news for the stock market and will have a softening effect on lending rates which will be a boost for stocks as people will more likely move funds from the money market to shares,&quot; Richard Chitumba, an investment expert with share market analysts Dataworld, told Reuters.</p>
<p>The good news on interest rates was offset by a continuing strike by civil servants pressing for wage rises of between 30 and 60 percent.</p>
<p>Representatives of thousands of strikers, emboldened by strong public support, said on Friday they would remain on the streets despite government threats to sack them.</p>
<p>But the share market focused on interest rates. Zimbabwe Stock Exchange chief executive Anthony Barfoot said there was already &quot;a lot of activity&quot; and share prices were high. &quot;It (the RBZ cut) is likely to push the value of the shares higher because companies should be able to make better profits,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The key industrial index, which has been rising steadily this week on foreign buying, ended Thursday 7.77 points up at 5,579.32.</p>
<p>Stock and money market analyst and columnist Charles Gurney said with falling interest rates, any double digit dividend yield should be able to offer value.</p>
<p>He said the gap between the rediscount and market rates had become &quot;glaringly large&quot; and had limited a recent slide to the lower 20s in short-term trading rates on the money market.</p>
<p>&quot;Counters that are highly geared yet able to exploit the resurgence in economic growth will benefit from the interest rate cuts,&quot; said Nigel Chanakira, another share market analyst.</p>
<p>Zimbabwean industrialists have been complaining that punitive borrowing rates of over 30 percent were frustrating expansion plans and eroding profit margins.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries (CZI) said the rate cut would bolster the country's fragile economic recovery from a drought which depressed growth in 1995.</p>
