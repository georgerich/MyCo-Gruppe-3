<headline>F.O. LICHT - Daily sugar report.</headline>
<text>
<p>The following is a direct contribution from statistician F.O. Licht in Ratzeburg, Germany. Please address any queries to Helmut Ahlfeld on +00 49 4541 88920.</p>
<p>FUNDAMENTALS</p>
<p>GERMANY - The second sugar beet test of 16 August shows a fairly satisfactory increase in root weight (131 grams vs 105 grams last year and the average (1991/95) of 122 grams). However, root weight remained with 477 grams, 6 per cent below that of last year and 7.8 per cent below average. As a result of the fairly low increase in sugar content, the increase in sugar per beet was only 23.8 grams vs 24.7 grams last year and the average of 23.5 grams. The sugar weight per ha on 12 August reached 6.07 tonnes, 2.9 per cent less than last year and 3.80 per cent below average. These figures point to a below average crop this season. However, what should not be overlooked is the high number of plants per ha which offers a good potential for further improvement and the high weight of beet leaves, which makes the plants more resistant against future dry spells.</p>
<p>FRANCE - The Fench beet test results of 12 August reflect recent unfavourable weather conditions. The increase in root weight was only 8.86 tonnes per ha against 9.99 tonnes last year and the average of 10.47 tonnes. The increase in sugar content was also below average which led to a highly unsatisfactory increase in sugar weight per ha (+1.49 tonnes vs 1.85 tonnes last year and the average of 1.78 tonnes). Sugar yield per ha on 12 August reached 6.21 tonnes, 10 per cent below that of last year and 15 per cent below average. These figures confirm that France will have a lower crop than last year's 4.601 million tonnes in raw value terms.</p>
<p>SINGAPORE - Sugar imports in April 1996 amounted to 27,977 tonnes, raw value, sharply up on last year's 14,179 tonnes. This brought cumulative imports in the first four months of 1996 (January/April) up to 95,692 tonnes against 90,264 tonnes in the like period the previous year. Total imports in 1995 reached 271,334 tonnes against 285,420 tonnes in 1994. Major countries of origin in January/April 1996 were Thailand with 61,000 tonnes raws against 8,000 tonnes and Malaysia with 20,901 tonnes whites compared to 18,688 tonnes. Sugar exports in January/April 1996 reached 4,618 tonnes, down from 7,082 tonnes in 1995. Total exports in 1995 amounted to 22,136 tonnes against 23,391 tonnes in 1994.</p>
<p>HONG KONG - Sugar imports in June 1996 amounted to 17,348 tonnes, raw value, down from 34,316 tonnes imported in June 1995. This brought cumulative imports in the first half of 1996 (January/June) up to 122,574 tonnes, hardly changed from last year's 121,255 tonnes. Total imports in 1995 reached 237,332 tonnes against 208,640 tonnes in 1994. Major countries of origin in the first half of 1996 were South Korea with 56,432 tonnes whites against 59,348 tonnes, Australia with 13,802 tonnes whites compared to 8,945 tonnes and Thailand with 12,000 tonnes raws against 12,500 tonnes. Sugar exports in June 1996 amounted to 3,124 tonnes which brought cumulative exports in January/June 1996 up to 38,682 tonnes compared to 24,553 tonnes in 1995. Total exports in 1995 reached 67,970 tonnes against 42,696 tonnes in 1994. The major country of destination in January/June 1996 continued to be China with 25,605 tonnes whites against 17,150 tonnes.</p>
<p>TENDERS</p>
<p>Syria has issued an international tender for 26,000 tonnes of raws and 26,000 tonnes of whites for October shipment. August 27 is set as the final date for offers.</p>
