<p>First-half profits at builder Hollandsche Beton Groep will be pressured by the long winter in Europe and a slack dredging market, analysts said.</p>
<p>HBG, due to publish first-half results next Tuesday, is seen booking net profit of between 38 and 48.5 million guilders, with consensus at 44.3 million.</p>
<p>This compares with a year-earlier 55 million guilders including a 15 million guilder extraordinary gain.</p>
<p>No extraordinaries are expected over the first 1996 half.</p>
<p>&quot;The strong winter in Europe, dredging and the poor German market will dent profits,&quot; ING's Paul Verbraeken said.</p>
<p>ING, which rates the stock a &quot;Sell&quot;, is forecasting first-half net down some five percent at 38 million guilders.</p>
<p>Germany accounted for 13 percent of HBG's turnover last year. Dredging, which accounts for some 10 percent of sales, generates an estimated 35 percent of net profit.</p>
<p>Deutsche Bank's Konrad Zomer said he was looking for first-half net of around 47 million guilders, but added &quot;that could be a little on the high side&quot;.</p>
<p>While Germany remained a difficult market, the group's UK activities had returned to profit in 1995 and would no longer drag down the company's bottom line, he said.</p>
<p>Dredging would not pose too many problems, Zomer added.</p>
<p>&quot;HBG is the only company never to have posted a loss on its dredging activities,&quot; Zomer said. &quot;That inspires confidence.&quot;</p>
<p>Deutsche Bank rates the stock as &quot;Overweight&quot;.</p>
<p>Bank Labouchere's Sven Smit was more downbeat, forecasting H1 net of 41.4 million guilders. He recommends a &quot;Hold&quot; on HBG.</p>
<p>&quot;Given dredging's contribution to group earnings, HBG earns precious little from its other building activities,&quot; Smit said.</p>
<p>This was due partly to the builder's concentration in Europe where money was tight, he said, but added &quot;Even so, HBG performs unfavourably compared with other Dutch builders.&quot;</p>
<p>HBG said in March it expected to hold profits steady in 1996 despite an absence of net extraordinaries which beefed up its bottom line by seven million guilders to 104.1 million guilders in 1995.</p>
