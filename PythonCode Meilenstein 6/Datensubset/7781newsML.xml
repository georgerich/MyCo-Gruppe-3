<p>Fixed-rate mortgages were slightly less affordable this week compared with last week as interest rates edged higher, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. said Thursday.</p>
<p>Thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages rose slightly to 7.93 percent in the week ending Aug. 23 from 7.88 percent the previous week. Fifteen-year loans averaged 7.45 percent, up from 7.39 percent.</p>
<p>But adjustable mortgage rates declined to 5.79 percent from 5.81 percent last week.</p>
<p>A year ago, the 30-year rate averaged 7.88 percent, the 15-year 7.39 percent, and the adjustable loan 5.96 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Inflation remains in check amid some evidence that economic growth has slowed a little,&quot; Frank Nothaft, Freddie Mac deputy chief economist, said. He noted that U.S. housing starts have declined over the past several months.</p>
<p>&quot;All these factors combined worked together to keep interest rates below 8 percent for the last three weeks,&quot; Nothaft added.</p>
<p>The Commerce Department last Friday said U.S. July housing starts fell 1.3 percent after declining 0.3 percent in June.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to leave interest rates unchanged. The FOMC next meets on Sept. 24.</p>
<p>Freddie Mac said lenders charged an average of 1.7 percent in fees and points on 30- and 15-year loans, both unchanged from last week. They charged 1.4 percent on adjustable mortgages, also unchanged from the previous week.</p>
