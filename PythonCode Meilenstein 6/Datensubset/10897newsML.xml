<headline>IPE gas oil ends steady, Brent eases with NYMEX.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-08-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>IPE gas oil closed unchanged on Friday, putting in a strong performance against Brent, which slipped on heavy U.S. selling and news that Mexico's crude export ports reopened after a two-day closure.</p>
<p>Sept gas oil closed at $191.00 a tonne, leaving the Sept/Oct backwardation unchanged at 75 cents.</p>
<p>Oct Brent had shed 10 cents to trade at $20.62 a barrel by 1638 GMT, having touched a low of $20.56. The Oct Brent/gas oil crack spread widened to $4.75 a barrel.</p>
<p>Traders said Brent was tracking NYMEX crude which had lost the support of heating oil futures.  </p>
<p>U.S. brokers were seen selling crude in favour of heating oil, but U.S. products were weaker nevertheless.</p>
<p>&quot;Products are not holding up well in the States,&quot; said one IPE floor broker. &quot;Heat is the strongest and that's still negative. I think (U.S. traders) were happy to see crude come off.&quot;</p>
<p>Mexico's three crude export ports on the Gulf of Mexico, Cayo Arcas, Pajaritos and Dos Bocas reopened on Friday after a two-day closure because of the threat posed by Hurricane Dolly.</p>
<p>The ports export an estimated 1.5 million barrels of crude daily. --London Newsroom +44 171 542 5387</p>
