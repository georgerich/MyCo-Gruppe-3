<p>Delegates of Angola's former rebel UNITA movement on Wednesday rejected the vice presidency offered to their leader in a proposed unity coalition with Angola's MPLA-led government.</p>
<p>The delegates shouted &quot;negative, negative&quot; after party secretary general Lukamba Gato told them they had to decide if UNITA accepted the post, offered to the movement's leader Jonas Savimbi under a peace deal.</p>
<p>&quot;It is an awkward, institutionalised system which will empty UNITA of its power and confuse the two leaders (Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and Savimbi),&quot; Gato told about 1,500 delegates at an extraordinary congress in UNITA's stronghold of Bailundo.</p>
<p>He said the vice presidency was &quot;cosmetic&quot;.</p>
<p>It was not clear whether the voice rejection by delegates was UNITA's final position on the offer.</p>
<p>Savimbi's chief peace negotiator Isaias Samakuva said ahead of the congress that if Savimbi accepted the vice-presidency, he would be based in Luanda from where it would be hard for him to run UNITA too.</p>
<p>&quot;If the congress elects Dr Savimbi he will come to Luanda, but Dr Savimbi has said he cannot be national vice-president as well as president of UNITA,&quot; Samakuva told Reuters.</p>
<p>Instead, some party officials suggested that UNITA's chief constitutional negotiator, Abel Chivukuvuku, could accept the vice presidency for the party.</p>
<p>Savimbi, 63, charismatic and with a reputation for ruthlessness, said before the congress meeting his UNITA colleagues had to accept or decline the post for him.</p>
<p>The congress, UNITA's main decision-making body, is meeting to reorganise its structures from a military-dominated movement into a political opposition. It will also decide whether to enter into a partnership with the MPLA.</p>
<p>Both sides signed a peace accord in November 1994 to end two decades of fighting which erupted after independence from Portugal in 1975.</p>
<p>In opening remarks to the congress, UNITA called for a revision of Angola's constitution and proposed that the current national assembly, whose mandate expires in November, be transformed into a constituent assembly.</p>
<p>&quot;As far as UNITA is concerned, the constitutional revision is fundamental and should involve all political parties represented in parliament in order to widen the debate.</p>
<p>&quot;The debate should not serve as an alibi to prolong the current mandate of parliament or annul the conclusion of the electoral process with regard to the run-off presidential poll.</p>
<p>&quot;Why not transform the current national assembly into the country's constituent assembly, charged with, besides other things, the need to strengthen local government through local government elections,&quot; UNITA said.</p>
<p>Savimbi, who was not present on the first day of this congress, is expected to address delegates on the last day of the four-day meeting.</p>
