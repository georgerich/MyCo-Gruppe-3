<p>The Russian army in Chechnya said it was preparing on Friday to withdraw from the rebel-dominated southern mountains of the region as part of a peace deal reached with the separatists a day earlier.</p>
<p>Interfax news agency quoted a source at the military command near the capital Grozny as saying: &quot;Preparations are going on now for the withdrawal of units from southern districts of the republic to the Chechen plain.&quot;</p>
<p>Alexander Lebed, President Boris Yeltsin's envoy to Chechnya, signed the deal with the separatist command on Thursday after overriding orders by Russian generals in the region for the bombing of the rebel-held capital.</p>
<p>Interfax said Russian forces were obliged under the agreement to leave a number of southwestern districts by Monday and quit the southern Shatoi district by Thursday, August 29.</p>
<p>&quot;Meeting these deadlines is very hard, so we made a start on withdrawing troops without delay,&quot; the military official said.</p>
<p>Interfax and Itar-Tass quoted army officials as saying preparations were also under way to form joint monitoring units with the guerrilla forces in Grozny to police the city and oversee the moving apart of the warring sides.</p>
<p>Tass said the units would drawn half from the Russian forces and half from the separatists.</p>
<p>A joint command post would be set up at the village of Starye Atagi, about 20 km (12 miles) south of Grozny and close to Novye Atagi, where Lebed signed the truce with rebel chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov.</p>
<p>Rebel spokesman Movladi Udugov told Reuters the separatist side was also making its preparations for the joint structure.</p>
<p>He added that was little fighting in Grozny ahead of the new ceasefire, which is due to go into effect across the region at midday (0800 GMT). The main firing, he said, came from Russian snipers who appeared to have no communication with their bases.</p>
<p>Interfax quoted the army command as saying there was virtually no fighting in Grozny on Friday morning.</p>
<p>Army positions had been fired on 19 times overnight in the region, including 13 times in the capital, it said.</p>
<p>An interior ministry spokesman told Tass one of its servicemen had been shot dead in Grozny overnight and an unknown number were wounded.</p>
