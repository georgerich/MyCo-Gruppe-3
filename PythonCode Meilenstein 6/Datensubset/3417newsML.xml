<p>Private Brazilian bank Bamerindus is likely to post a 20 million real net profit in the first six months of the year, O Globo newspaper said.</p>
<p>Bamerindus is due to send its first half results to Brazil's Securities and Exchange Commission (CVM) today and to publish the balance sheet Wednesday.</p>
<p>O Globo said Bamerindus' recent reorganization of assets allowed the bank to close the January-to-June period in the black.  </p>
<p>Last month, Bamerindus Group unveiled a restructuring plan under which Bamerindus' profitable insurance company was absorbed by the bank, while its past due loans, worth 680 million reais, were transferred to the group's holding company.</p>
<p>Despite the positive results, the Central Bank will require an injection of at least 1.0 billion reais in the bank to solve Bamerindus' liquidity troubles, O Globo said.</p>
<p>Bamerindus, Brazil's fourth-largest private bank, has been in recent months plagued by rumors of liquidity problems and speculation that the bank would be sold.</p>
<p>Veja weekly magazine over the weekend said government officials were considering two alternatives for the bank: the sale to a private bank or a group of banks, or the intervention by the central bank followed by the use of PROER credits to encourage potential buyers.  </p>
<p>Veja also said private banks Bradesco, Banco Itau and Banco Safra would be studying the purchase of the bank.</p>
<p>Bamerindus press officials, however, denied any talks with other financial institutions to transfer the control of the bank.</p>
