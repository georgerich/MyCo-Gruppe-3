<p>Irish government bonds edged up in thin late trade on Friday as the market focus switched away from international interest rates and turned to the international currency markets, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have slightly out-performed gilts and bunds on the day but really the relativities have not changed that much. Activity has been very light,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;Most of the response to the Bundesbank's decision to cut its repo rate by 30 basis points occurred on Thursday, with a lot of short-covering at the short-end. Market focus has switched to currencies, particularly the dollar,&quot; the dealer added.  </p>
<p>By 1513 GMT, the 8.00 percent bond due 2000 had risen five pence from Thursday's close at 104.00 to yield 6.74 percent while the 8.00 percent bond due 2006 had risen 10p from the close at 103.15 to yield 7.41 percent.</p>
<p>The key one-month money rate was at 5.56/.69, unchanged from Thursday's close.</p>
<p>Dealers said market focus was likely to remain on the U.S. over the short-term.</p>
<p>&quot;If the dollar's fortunes improve, it will improve because of internal factors in the States. People will be looking for a lead from the U.S. next week,&quot; the dealer said.</p>
<p>The dollar remained in tight ranges in late European trade, bumping along the session lows and unruffled by a jump in U.S. July durable goods orders.</p>
<p>The orders rose 1.6 percent against an average of a 0.3 percent rise and a revised figure of a 0.2 percent fall in June.</p>
