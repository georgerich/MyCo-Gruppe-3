<p>Zimbabwean industrial shares stayed predictably on a mixed to firmer path on Thursday, with advancers outstripping losers comfortably to push the key industrial index 7.77 points up to 5,579.32.</p>
<p>Brokers attributed the strong trade to foreign buyers again, and noted, for the second day running, that local investors were keeping a wary eye on a rare strike by Zimbabwean civil servants for higher wages which some fear may spark similar industrial unrest in the private sector.</p>
<p>&quot;Foreign buyers were in the driving seat again today. Although some local players returned to the market many are still watching the ongoing strike to see how far it goes and its implications,&quot; one broker said.</p>
<p>The Zimbabwe Stock Exchange (ZSE)'s 57-share industrial was boosted on Thursday by gains in some key counters, including banking groups Barclays, 50 cents higher at 1,650, and Finhold, which rose 20 cents to 630.</p>
<p>The seven-share mining index rose 2.91 points to 1,252.15 after a 25 cents gain in nickel producer Bindura at 1,050.</p>
