<p>SUGAR: World market for August 21, 1996</p>
<p>White sugar futures in London closed mixed in quiet dealings as New York market failed to give direction. October closed $0.20 higher at $353.50, while December shed $0.40 to close at $346.40. In New York raw sugar futures ended narrowly mixed as the market remained stuck in its recent trading range. October added one point to close at 11.82 cents/lb, while March closed one point lower at 11.46 cents/lb. The deferreds lost between 2 and 7 points. There was no fresh news to influence prices.</p>
<p>FUNDAMENTALS</p>
<p>BELGIUM - The second Belgian beet tests of August 19, 1996 show a significant rise in beet weight after the return of rains, while sugar content dropped. Beet weight per ha rose by over 15 tonnes to 46.18 tonnes against a rise of 8.51 tonnes in 1995 to 40.29 tonnes. However, beet weight is still below the five-year average (1991/95) of 48.35 tonnes. Sugar content on the other hand dropped sharply to 14.04 per cent from 15.94 per cent against the 1995 result of 15.93 per cent and the five-year average of 14.29 per cent. This resulted in a sugar weight per ha of 6.48 tonnes, white value, up from last year's 6.42 tonnes, but still below the five-year average of 6.90 tonnes. Leaf weight per ha has further improved to 45.12 tonnes compared to 34.35 tonnes in 1995 and the average of 53.01 tonnes. The rather high leaf weight is an indication that the crop has still potential to improve. Meanwhile signs are that Belgium will have a slightly higher crop than last year's 964,000 tonnes, raw value.</p>
<p>HUNGARY - The second beet test results of August 12, 1996 confirm that recent rains have brought a significant increase in beet weight. The average root weight on August 12 was 646 grams, 171 grams more than in the previous test compared to 491 grams in the second test of 1995 after a rise of 64 grams. Sugar content rose only slightly to 15.0 per cent, down from the 1995 result of 15.7 per cent. However, the increase in root weight was sufficient to boost sugar weight per root to the rather satisfactory level of 96.9 grams. Unfortunately the beet test results do not give any indication as to the number of beets per ha which is crucial for determining the production potential. However, the rather high sugar weight is a sign that the lower area sown to beet (112,000 ha versus 124,000 ha) might not affect overall sugar production.</p>
<p>TURKEY - The third beet test of July 15, 1996 confirms that the sugar crop is still lagging behind the 1995 results. Root weight per ha reached 17.53 tonnes, down from 19.87 tonnes in 1995 while sugar content rose to 11.4 per cent, up from 11.2 per cent in 1995. As a result sugar yield rose to 2.0 tonnes, white value, per ha, down 10 per cent from the 1995 result. Given the rather low number of beets per ha (78,580 vs 82,570) and the lower leaf weight per ha (23.31 vs 26.6 tonnes) in 1996 the potential for improvement seems rather limited. Nevertheless, Turkey will have a much improved sugar crop as the area sown to beet rose by 120,000 ha to 420,000 ha.</p>
<p>TENDERS</p>
<p>The European Union awarded 18,000 tonnes of white sugar at a maximum refund of ECU 43.032 per 100 kg at its weekly tender on Wednesday. Cumulative awards so far made under the 1996/97 series of tenders for the period up to August 21 reached 74,000 tonnes, which compares to 109,000 tonnes last year.</p>
