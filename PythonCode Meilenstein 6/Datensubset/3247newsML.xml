<title>RUSSIA: Russian oil excise tax collected, rates not final.</title>
<headline>Russian oil excise tax collected, rates not final.</headline>

<p>Russia is collecting taxes on domestic and export sales of crude oil but is charging calculated, preliminary tariffs, the State Tax Service said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The government has set the average tax on oil sales to 70,000 roubles... But the ministry of finance and the ministry of fuel and energy must work out rates for each individual oil company,&quot; said tax service spokesman Alexander Yeryomin.</p>
<p>The government must publish a new order with the ministries' rates, and until then the tax service and customs must charge preliminary, calculated rates, he said by telephone.</p>
<p>&quot;Until the new rates are announced (excise taxes) collected will be based on (average) rates... Later, for some it may turn out to be more and for some it may be less,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Russia in July dropped oil export taxes to meet International Monetary Fund requirements for a $10 billion, three-year credit.</p>
<p>The Fund argued that export tariffs distorted trade and urged Russia to replace the revenue from oil export duties with a general excise duty on all oil sales.</p>
<p>The government made the move, raising the average excise tax to 70,000 as of July 1, but no new breakdown has been announced.</p>
<p>The State Customs Committee announced calculated rates which went into effect August 1.</p>
<p>But the government has not announced whether oil companies, which paid calculated rates in July are responsible retroactively for discrepancies between calculated rates and as yet unpublished official rates.</p>
<p>Yeryomin said the final decision on back payments would be handed down in a government order.</p>
<p>Presently, customs and the state tax service are charging the same calculated rates, they both say.</p>
<p>&quot;The same price is paid to the customs committee for export and to the tax service for domestic sales,&quot; said Vladimir Yemelyanov, deputy head of the customs committee's press service.</p>
<p>The calculated rate ranges from 51,649 to 82,536 roubles per tonne of oil, as published by the customs committee, and vary by exporter.</p>
<p>Neither customs nor tax service spokesmen were able to say when the government would issue its new order.</p>
