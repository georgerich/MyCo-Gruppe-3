<p>Winning Wimbledon has completely altered Richard Krajicek's outlook and expectations as he prepares for the U.S. Open, which begins on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;I think I can win here,&quot; said the seventh-ranked Dutchman, brimming with new-found confidence.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a different feeling, for sure, than all the other times that I've played here,&quot; he said Thursday prior to giving a clinic in Central Park for inner-city children from the Arthur Ashe Safe Passage Foundation</p>
<p>&quot;I always felt that I had a good chance of making a good result, but yes, this is the first time I've felt that I can win,&quot; admitted Krajicek, who is seeded fifth for the year's final Grand Slam event.</p>
<p>&quot;Before I used to look too much to who I meet in the fourth round, the quarter-finals,&quot; said Krajicek. &quot;I go more round by round now. It's somehow helped me more. I keep my focus on the match I'm playing and not the match I might play if I win the next three matches.&quot;</p>
<p>The lanky 6-foot, 5-inch (1.95m) Krajicek went out in the third round at Flushing Meadow last year and has not been past the fourth round in five U.S. Open appearances.</p>
<p>But all those early exits became irrelevant when the big-serving 24-year-old become the first Dutchman to win a Grand Slam with his stunning victory at Wimbledon last month.</p>
<p>&quot;I have won a Grand Slam so I am able to win seven matches in two weeks,&quot; said Krajicek, who ousted three-time defending champion Pete Sampras in the quarter-finals and beat another surprise finalist in American MaliVai Washington to claim the sport's most coveted title.</p>
<p>&quot;As long as I hadn't won one, my feeling was just to do well,&quot; said Krajicek, whose previous best Grand Slam showings were reaching the 1993 French Open semifinals and the 1992 Australian Open semis.</p>
<p>&quot;Now I really have the feeling that if I play the right game, that I can go all the way.&quot;</p>
