<p>Fresh shell craters and burning buildings scarred Grozny's desolate landscape on Wednesday even before the expiry of a Russian ultimatum to rebel fighters to get out of the Chechen capital or face destruction.</p>
<p>But, amid the explosions and smoke and the battle cries of the unyielding rebels, the most chilling sight remained the small clusters of elderly civilians, some struggling to leave town, others planning to stay.</p>
<p>Mangy, dust-laden stray cats and dogs far outnumbered people in the streets of the ruined city centre, where a market had bustled until a couple of weeks ago -- a potent symbol of Chechnya's dogged survival through 20 months of war.</p>
<p>But a flimsy hand-written cry for help offered up by one refugee provided an indication that many more people, possibly thousands, were still cringing in the city's cellars.</p>
<p>&quot;Our houses are bombarded continuously by heavy weapons. We are in a desperate state, without bread, water or light. There are no fighters in our houses, no soldiers, and no one is firing from them, but the bombardment never stops.</p>
<p>&quot;We feel that we have been abandoned in our own country. We ask that you do everything possible to stop this war,&quot; said the appeal, scrawled in ballpoint pen and signed by 32 names.</p>
<p>&quot;There are people left in basements all over the city,&quot; said Zoya, her face dripping with sweat from the flames shooting 10 metres (30 feet) into the air from gas mains hit during the past two weeks of renewed street to street fighting.</p>
<p>One elderly woman scurried through the marketplace shell and sniper fire rang out around here. Planes and helicopters flew overhead.</p>
<p>A Russian armoured personnel carrier commandeered by the fighters and painted with Chechen rebel symbols was tucked quietly between two buildings nearby.</p>
<p>Other fighters careered around the city in jeeps and cars, shouting out the Chechen battle cry.</p>
<p>Kokha, 31, among a group of around 20 fighters in the southwestern district of Chernorechye, had a submachine gun with ammunition strung around his back.</p>
<p>&quot;They've bombed for two years and it hasn't changed a thing,&quot; said Kohka, who said he had worked in Russia as a driver for 10 years before coming back to fight for independence when Russian troops poured in during the last month of 1994.</p>
<p>And what, he was asked, would happen if the Russians carried out their threat to carpet bomb Grozny?</p>
<p>&quot;If they do something like that, then we'll just go to Russia and make them another Chernobyl. Then we'll see how long the war will last,&quot; he said, referring to Ukraine's Chernobyl nuclear reactor disaster in 1986.</p>
<p>The sunny sky was shrouded in a haze from burning buildings, including a refinery which appeared to have been hit from the air. A cloud of black smoke rose skywards.</p>
<p>A woman sat against a wall by the gateway of her one-storey house in the centre of the city, near a house on fire and another where journalists once lodged.</p>
<p>&quot;There were reporters here last night but they've left now,&quot; she said simply, showing no signs of planning to follow suit.</p>
<p>There were few people on the bridge where more than a thousand refugees had poured through on Tuesday, when residents heard about the ultimatum issued on Monday by the Russian military to the rebels to get out within 48 hours.</p>
<p>&quot;Can you help us get the three guys out of that jeep?&quot; said a passer-by. Smoke and flames were rising from the vehicle, which had taken a fatal turning towards Russian troops who had dug in out of sight of the road.</p>
<p>A few horses and carts were piled with belongings, and other people drove cows and sheep out of city.</p>
<p>Anatoly and Valentina Kupatsov, ethnic Russians, were like most of the others, fleeing on foot.</p>
<p>&quot;Our neighbours said they thought they heard on the radio that the bombing would begin today. Before that we didn't know anything. They only told us yesterday,&quot; said Anatoly, carrying a fishing rod among his few belongings.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't even know where we're going. We don't have any money. Just what we could grab on the way out of the house.&quot;</p>
<p>Russia's security supremo, Alexander Lebed, whom President Boris Yeltsin had ordered to restore control over Grozny seized by rebels on August 6, was visiting the region on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe we can go home after the bombing stops, we heard Lebed was coming today. Maybe that means everything that will end peacefully,&quot; said Valentina, the hope in her words overwhelmed by the dejection in her voice.</p>
