<p>U.S. mortgage-backed securities slid lower on the heels of a dip in Treasuries prices during very light trading on Wednesday afternoon, traders said.</p>
<p>Late on Wednesday, pass-throughs were off 1/32 to 7/32 overall and spreads were one or two basis points tighter to Treasuries yields.</p>
<p>&quot;It has been a low-volatility market, which is positive for mortgage paper,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>The 30-year bond dipped dipped further, off 17/32 in mid-afternoon trade before rebounding slightly to off 14/32.  </p>
<p>&quot;We tend to tighten in a down move,&quot; one trader said of mortgage backeds.</p>
<p>Late on Wednesday, GNMA 30-year 7.5 percent coupons were off 3/32 at 99-08/32, yielding 108 basis points over 10-year Treasuries.</p>
<p>Comparable FNMAs were off 4/32 at 99-04/32. And FHLMC 30-year 7.5 percent pass-throughs were off 5/32 at 99-07/32.</p>
<p>The market could stay range-bound through the rest of August, traders and fixed-income analysts said. The next important data should be the August employment report, set for release September 6, they said.</p>
