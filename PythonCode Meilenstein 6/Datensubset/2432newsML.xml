<p>China is urging its colour television producers to end a price war, saying it is hurting the domestic industry and helping foreign brands, the Economic Daily said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The price war -- touched off in March by industry giant Sichuan Changhong Electric Appliances Co ltd -- was an attempt to counter rampant smuggling of foreign TVs and rising domestic stockpiles, Liu Jianfeng, vice minister of the Ministry of Electronics Industry was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>Smuggling has been a major problem, allowing many vendors to avoid duties and making foreign brands very competitive compared to domestic television sets.</p>
<p>The price slashing has cut into earnings of domestic makers. Major companies in the domestic television market include Shenzhen Konka Electronics (Group) Co Ltd and Hong Kong-listed Nanjing Panda Electronics Co Ltd.</p>
<p>The newspaper did not list any specific measures to be taken but it pointed to high-level government concern over the impact on the domestic industry.</p>
<p>Television makers should upgrade their technology and strengthen management instead of slashing prices to promote sales, Liu said.</p>
<p>The price cuts were putting increasing pressure on domestic producers and some small-scale firms had already been forced out of business, it said.</p>
<p>&quot;The price cuts will cause domestic producers to kill each other off, which is harmful to both producers and the state,&quot; it quoted Liu as saying.</p>
<p>Foreign firms that had set up joint ventures in China using high technology and cheap labour would benefit and capture a larger market share, it said.</p>
<p>Foreign joint ventures, however, say they too are victims of the smuggling as they are finding it hard to compete with the illegally imported products.</p>
<p>Smuggled and legally imported sets accounted for 40 percent of the 13.6 million colour televisions sold in China in 1995, official figures show. Foreign brands produced in China had a 24 percent market share and domestic brands 36 percent.</p>
