<headline>GOLF-BROADHURST SHOOTS COURSE RECORD TO TAKE LEAD IN GERMAN OPEN.</headline>

<p>Briton Paul Broadhurst shot a course record nine-under-par 62 to establish a two-shot lead in the first round of the German Open on Thursday.</p>
<p>It was the 31-year-old's lowest ever score on the European Tour and left him clear of six players who took advantage of near perfect conditions to compile 64s and finish on seven under.</p>
<p>&quot;This course is playing so easily someone will break 60 this week,&quot; said Broadhurst, who lost the Scandinavian Masters in a play-off three weeks ago. &quot;It would not surprise me at all.</p>
<p>&quot;To win here, if the weather stays as it is, you will need to shoot at least 20 under, maybe 22, but I'm very happy with my position.&quot;</p>
<p>The chasing group includes Welshman Ian Woosnam, who arrived late and did not have a practice round, and local hero Bernhard Langer, carrying an injury to two fingers in his right hand.</p>
<p>Englishman David J. Russell, Northern Irishman Ronan Rafferty, Michael Campbell of New Zealand and Sweden's Mats Lanner also shot 64 to share second place.</p>
