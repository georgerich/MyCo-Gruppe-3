<p>It may not come as a surprise to chocolate junkies, but scientists in California said on Wednesday they had found another chemical in chocolate that could explain its addictive properties.</p>
<p>The chemical mimics the effects of cannabis, Daniele Piomelli and colleagues at the Neurosciences Institute in San Diego said.</p>
<p>They looked at the molecule, anandamide, because it is a brain lipid, or fat -- and of course chocolate is high in fat. They said it could act as a neurotransmitter, a chemical that carries signals between brain cells.</p>
<p>Writing in the science journal Nature, they said tests showed chocolate contained varying amounts of anandamide while white chocolate, made of milk and cocoa butter, and coffee did not.</p>
<p>Chocolate contains three different versions of anandamide, which could activate receptors in brain cells that are known to react to chemicals in cannabis.</p>
<p>They said further experiments were needed to see if the chemicals would have this effect in a living animal.</p>
<p>&quot;Canniboid drugs are known to heighten sensitivity and produce euphoria. A possible effect of elevated brain anandamide levels could be to intensify the sensory properties of chocolate thought to be essential to craving,&quot; they wrote.</p>
<p>Previous efforts to explain chocolate's appeal have focused on phenylethylamine, a molecule closely related to amphetamines. These drugs raise blood pressure and blood sugar levels, making people feel more alert and sometimes creating a sense of well-being.</p>
<p>Some studies have also said the chemical is secreted when people fall in love.</p>
<p>Chocolate also contains caffeine, which is addictive, and a very similar chemical known as theobromine. And cocoa butter melts just at body temperature -- meaning pure chocolate literally melts in the mouth, providing a very pleasant sensation.</p>
<p>Some researchers say bingeing on chocolate could be a form of self-medication.</p>
<p>Britons spend three billion pounds a year ($5 billion) on the confection, while Americans spent $11 billion. In Switzerland enough is sold for each citizen to eat 21 pounds (9.5 kg) a year.</p>
