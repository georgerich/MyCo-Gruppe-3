<p>Australia cricket captain Mark Taylor was recovering in hospital on Thursday after surgery on his back, his management company said.</p>
<p>Taylor underwent an apparently successful operation on Wednesday to repair a damaged disc, a spokeswoman told Reuters.</p>
<p>The back injury prevented the left-handed opener from leading Australia on their current tour to Sri Lanka for a four-nation limited-overs tournament.</p>
<p>&quot;It's just a matter of his recovery taking its normal course,&quot; the spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>Before entering hospital, Taylor said he expected it would take about three weeks for him to regain fitness after the surgery.</p>
<p>Taylor hopes to resume playing before Australia leave for India in early October to play a one-off test against their hosts and a limited-overs tournament.</p>
<p>Wicketkeeper Ian Healy has assumed the captaincy for the two-week Singer tournament, starting on August 26, involving hosts Sri Lanka, India and Zimbabwe.</p>
