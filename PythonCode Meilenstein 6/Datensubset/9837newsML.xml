<p>India's tobacco giant ITC Ltd has recorded a 22 percent hike in its tobacco sales volume in four months to July 1996, its chairman Yogi Deveshwar said on Thursday.</p>
<p>ITC Ltd is 31.8 percent controlled by B.A.T Industries Plc.</p>
<p>Deveshwar, facing shareholders for the first time as the company's chairman at the annual shareholders' meeting, faced questions on recent media reports of mismanagment within the company.</p>
<p>The chairman said the company was doing well and shareholders had nothing to worry about its net profits which came in at 2.61 billion rupees in 1995/96 from 2.62 billion in the previous year.</p>
<p>Authorities have been questioning a few ITC executives as part of probe into alleged violation of foreign exchange norms in international trade deals.</p>
<p>&quot;To the best of our knowledge there has been no FERA violation, it all depends on interpretation of laws,&quot; Deveshwar said.</p>
<p>Deveshwar also denied recent reports that B.A.T had already hiked its stake in the firm from its current 31.8 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;I have no knowledge of such things. As far as I know B.A.T has not increased its stake,&quot; Deveshwar said.</p>
<p>B.A.T recently said it was interested in increasing its presence in India but announced no immediate intentions to hike its stake in ITC Ltd.</p>
