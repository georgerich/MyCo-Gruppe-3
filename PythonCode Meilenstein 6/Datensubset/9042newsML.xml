<p>A spokesman for Burundi's new military ruler on Thursday rejected a human rights group report that more than 6,000 people were killed in the first three weeks after a July 25 coup.</p>
<p>(Correction makes clear that not all 6,000 killings blamed on the army).</p>
<p>In a statement, the London-based human rights group Amnesty International said human rights in Burundi were deteriorating despite promises by Tutsi military ruler Pierre Buyoya to end killings.</p>
<p>&quot;Amnesty International is either completely misguided or is falling into propaganda. I am positive they are misinformed and that these numbers are outrageous,&quot; Buyoya's spokesman Jean-Luc Ndizeye said.</p>
<p>&quot;You cannot have this number of people killed in such short a time in Burundi without there being a civil outcry,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Amnesty International said more than 6,000 people were reported to have been killed in various parts of Burundi. It said it had learned at least 4,050 unarmed civilians were buried after being extrajudicially executed between July 27 and August 10 by government forces in Giheta district in the central province of Gitega.</p>
<p>Amnesty International said most of the 4,050 were killed after the army came to obtain information about rebel movements.</p>
<p>&quot;This pattern is being repeated in other parts of the country,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>At a news conference before the Amnesty International statement, Buyoya said he opposed killings but they could not be expected simply to cease overnight after he had taken power.</p>
<p>&quot;Just because there was a change on July 25 it doesn't mean that all the activities of war or the massacres will stop. We are in the process of putting in place the building blocks so that security can return and massacres can stop,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>More than 150,000 people -- mainly civilians -- have been killed in Burundi since 1993 in massacres and civil war between the Tutsi-dominated army and rebels of the Hutu majority.</p>
<p>U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali in a report to the Security Council this week recommended countries assemble a force of 50,000 to intervene if Burundi plunged into genocide, like that in neighbouring Rwanda in 1994 in which up to a million people died.</p>
<p>Amnesty International said despite Buyoya's promises to halt expulsions of Rwandan refugees they were continuing with troops using torture and killings to frighten Rwandans into leaving.</p>
<p>&quot;It appears Major Buyoya has either gone back on his word or is not in control of the forces which brought him to power,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>Asked to comment, Ndizeye said: &quot;For sure Buyoya is in full control of every part of the army. He is the commander in chief and the rest is pure speculation or totally unfounded.&quot;</p>
<p>Ndizeye said the return of Rwandan refugees was in cooperation with the U.N. refugee agency and was voluntary. The U.N. refugee agency said on Thursday it had ended the repatriation of more than 45,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees.</p>
