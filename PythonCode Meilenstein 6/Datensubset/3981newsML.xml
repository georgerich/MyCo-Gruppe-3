<p>Silver still needed to clear $5.26 per ounce to push even higher after rallying to 2-1/2 month highs overnight, analysts said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>A helping hand from gold, which has so far ignored silver's progress, may also be a crucial element to cement further gains in both metals, they added.</p>
<p>&quot;Silver is not out of the woods yet. It's still a component of a trading range. But getting up past that $5.15-$5.16 area is a positive step,&quot; said chartist Cliff Green of Trend Analysis.</p>
<p>Silver fixed at $5.2025 an ounce on Tuesday, the highest fixing since June 19, compared to $5.0825 a day earlier. Dealers attributed the rise to chart-driven fund buying.</p>
<p>Silver had been trending lower since peaking at a fix of $5.8275 in early February. Prices have been wedged in a $5.00-$5.15 range for a month.</p>
<p>Analyst Susan Rigg of Chart Analysis Ltd said silver's challenge to June peaks in the $5.20-$5.30 area indicated a long-absent upwards dynamic.</p>
<p>&quot;I think now it is beginning to break the downtrend which has been in course since the beginning of the year, provided it can maintain its momentum,&quot; Rigg said.</p>
<p>But silver faced substantial supply coming in above current levels from trading earlier this year, she added.</p>
<p>However, clearing the $5.25 level would complete a rounding pattern, making the metal's breach of the $5.00 level in late July look like a &quot;false breakdown&quot;, analyst Elli Gifford of Investment Research of Cambridge said in a commentary.</p>
<p>Then prices could be projected as high as $5.40, she said.</p>
<p>Green pegged silver's upside targets at $5.42 and then possibly $5.53 after clearing the $5.25-$5.26 hurdle.</p>
<p>Several analysts, however, said gold's less than enthusiastic response may cause silver to stumble. Bullion was indicated at $387.30/$387.80 an ounce, less than $1.00 up from Monday's London close.</p>
<p>The lack of response in gold was reminiscent of silver's failure to rally when gold made an attempt to pass $390 earlier this month, Green said.</p>
<p>&quot;To really regenerate some interest and real momentum in these markets, we need to see gold and silver working in tandem,&quot; he added. &quot;If gold went through $390 and silver through $5.26, then I'd be more interested in the complex as a whole.&quot;</p>
