<p>Cuba's ruling Communist Party said on Wednesday it was in favour of greater internal democracy but it should not threaten national unity and democratic centralism would remain its guiding principle.</p>
<p>The Cuban party said in an analysis published in the party newspaper Granma that it would not renounce &quot;the principle of Democratic Centralism,&quot; which is traditionally an ideological pillar of Communist Party states.</p>
<p>This was a clear message that the leadership remained committed, despite increasing foreign pressure, to preserving its existing one-party political system. But the document said this commitment did not contradict the need for &quot;an ever greater democracy within the body of the party.&quot;</p>
<p>It defined this as &quot;all the space necessary for the expression of ideas, proposals, opinions, whether they coincide or disagree, about any issue, however polemic or complicated.&quot;</p>
<p>But the document, which was being published in daily instalments by Granma, went on to say that there could be no room for &quot;tendencies which weaken the discipline and political activity of the party.&quot; It added that this encouragement of internal democracy &quot;cannot be allowed to threaten the essential unity of our existence as an independent nation.&quot;</p>
<p>The need for unity in the face of external hostility, particularly from Cuba's ideological enemy the United States, was one of the arguments regularly used by President Fidel Castro to explain why his government continued to reject the idea of Western-style multi-party democracy.</p>
<p>Cuban authorities, invoking the island's constitution and laws, which defend the existence of a one-party state, treat internal political opposition groups as illegal and often persecute their members, accusing them of being &quot;counter-revolutionaries&quot; in the service of the United States.</p>
<p>The Cuban government last week revoked the visa of a U.S. diplomat at the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, accusing her of actively supporting and organising Cuban dissident groups. Washington denied this and expelled a Cuban diplomat in reply.</p>
<p>The analysis document said the aim of U.S. policy was still the destruction of the &quot;Cuban Revolution&quot; -- official Cuban shorthand for the island's one-party socialist system.</p>
<p>It also said religious values, when honestly put into practice, were good for the country and its people. This reflected a policy of greater tolerance toward religion adopted by the ruling party in recent years, a contrast to the overt hostility and suspicion that marked church-state relations immediately after the 1959 revolution.</p>
