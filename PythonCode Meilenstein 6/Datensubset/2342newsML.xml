<p>Taipei gave a positive but cautious response to China's release on Tuesday of rules governing direct shipping links across the Taiwan Strait, even though such links are still banned by Taiwan.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course we are happy to see it accomplished, but would prefer to comment after we have more details,&quot; said an official with the island's Ministry of Transportation and Communications.</p>
<p>The island's top agency for China policymaking, the cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council, gave a cooler response, saying Beijing's rules were belated and &quot;mingled with sensitive political issues&quot;.</p>
<p>The regulations, effective from Tuesday, allow only wholly Chinese-owned or Taiwan-owned shipping companies or joint ventures involving Chinese or Taiwanese shipowners to sail between the two sides, Beijing's Xinhua news agency said.</p>
<p>&quot;The regulations...are meant to promote cargo and passenger transport between the two sides of the Straits and accelerate the development of direct mail service, trade, and air and shipping links across the Straits,&quot; Xinhua said.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's Beijing-backed Wen Wei Po daily said China's southeastern ports at Xiamen and Fuzhou would be the first to be opened to direct shipping links with Taiwan.</p>
<p>&quot;The conditions for (establishing) direct shipping links are ripe,&quot; the newspaper said.</p>
<p>Taipei's Mainland Affairs Council urged Beijing to be practical and remove barriers that have prevented direct links.</p>
<p>&quot;...The mainland's direct links plan is still mingled with sensitive political issues,&quot; it said. &quot;We hope the mainland side can adopt a practical attitude to remove obstacles blocking links across the strait.&quot; It did not elaborate.</p>
<p>Taiwan has banned direct air and shipping links with China since Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists lost the civil war to the Chinese communists and fled to the island in 1949.</p>
<p>China views Taiwan as a renegade province.</p>
<p>With tensions easing since the late 1980s, civilian aircraft and vessels have skirted the ban by stopping over in Hong Kong, Macau or other third countries.</p>
<p>To fulfil its ambition of becoming an Asia-Pacific business hub, Taiwan proposed in 1995 to set up an offshore transshipment centre at southern Kaohsiung port from which ships would be allowed to sail directly between Taiwan and China.</p>
<p>The project has been delayed by sovereignty issues, with squabbling over Chinese and Taiwanese flags and documents that would bear the names and marks from both governments and might be interpreted by either side as reciprocal recognition.</p>
<p>&quot;It (Beijing's plan) is similar to our offshore transshipment centre plan,&quot; transport ministry spokesman Hsu Chieh-kuei said on state television.</p>
<p>&quot;It will be good if we can find a way to resolve the sea links problem across the Taiwan Strait,&quot; Hsu said. &quot;We will carefully study the counterproposals.&quot;</p>
<p>Taiwan investors, who have poured more than $20 billion into China, have pressured the government to establish such links to save transportation costs.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a breakthrough,&quot; Taiwan global shipping giant Evergreen Marine Corp said in a statement. &quot;The company welcomes the decision from the business point of view.&quot;</p>
