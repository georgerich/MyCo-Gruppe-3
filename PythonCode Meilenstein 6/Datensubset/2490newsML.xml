<p>CompuServe Inc., the No. 2 online service, Tuesday reported a $29.6 million fiscal first-quarter loss and said it would cut 150 jobs, or 4 percent of its work force, as part of a $30 million cost-cutting programme.</p>
<p>The Columbus, Ohio-based company also said it would sell its Spry Inc. software unit as part of the cost cuts.  </p>
<p>The loss of $29.6 million, or 32 cents a share, in the fiscal first quarter ended July 31, compared with last year's quarterly profit of $26.8 million, or 36 cents a share.</p>
<p>The company said it expected losses to continue into the second fiscal quarter due to the costs of new product introduction, but predicted improved earnings in the second half of fiscal 1997.</p>
