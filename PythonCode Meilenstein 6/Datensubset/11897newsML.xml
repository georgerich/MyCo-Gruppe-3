<p>U.S. stocks are expected to open higher, with the Dow Industrials, near a record closing high, taking their cue from bonds and tobacco stocks.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot depends on the tobacco trial in Indiana and, of course, the bond market,&quot; said Peter Cardillo, director of research at Westfalia Investments. &quot;My guess is that if the durable goods orders come in on the weaker side, we will see a pop in the bond market.&quot;</p>
<p>The government reports durable goods orders for July at 0830 EDT/1230 GMT. A 0.3 percent rise is expected.  </p>
<p>Cardillo said a strong bond market should give stocks &quot;a chance to rally, and if not surpass that (Dow) high, at least reach highs on an intraday basis.&quot;</p>
<p>The Dow rose 42 points to 5733 on Thursday, leaving the blue chip index within shouting distance of its record closing high of 5778, set on May 22.</p>
<p>&quot;Stocks will probably open higher as a carry-through from yesterday,&quot; said Hildegard Zagorski of Prudential Securities. &quot;But I don't know whether we have enough steam in this market to (set a new closing high).&quot;  </p>
<p>She added, &quot;We're still in the summer doldrums, and the weekend is coming up. Even yesterday's advance was under fairly low volume.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts said investors' eyes were fixed on the Indiana state court trial of a tobacco damages lawsuit. The jury was to resume deliberations today.</p>
<p>The family of a man who died of lung cancer is suing units of Philip Morris Cos Inc, RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp, Brooke Group Ltd and B.A.T Industries Plc, contending the industry was at fault for selling an addictive product that caused cancer.  </p>
<p>&quot;If Philip Morris and other tobacco stocks become an issue, they are going to influence the Dow,&quot; said Cardillo.</p>
<p>He said it appeared that momentum exists for the market to test new highs. In the near term he looks for the Dow to set a new closing high, fall back briefly, then reach 5875.</p>
<p>Zagorski expects the durable goods data to show a rise, but if the gain is weaker than expected, &quot;it could spark a rally in bonds that could in turn give life to the stock market.&quot;  </p>
<p>If technology issues resume their Thursday rally, that could prove a boost to the overall market, analysts said.</p>
<p>The Tokyo stock market rally ended on Friday after four days of gains. The Nikkei 225 index closed down 134.44 points at 21,228.80 as traders took profits.</p>
<p>The FTSE 100 index rose 12.9 to 3904 in Friday trade, with U.S. shares narrowly mixed. Philip Morris rose 1/2 to 87-3/8 after falling 7/8 to 86-3/4 in the U.S. on Thursday. Auto shares were mixed. The United Auto Workers union delayed choosing a strike target and may try to bargain simultaneously with the Big Three U.S. automakers.  </p>
<p>The dollar erased early small losses against the mark in Tokyo and had clawed back to the 1.49 level by late trading. In Europe the dollar hovered below 1.49 marks in quiet trading.</p>
<p>In Tokyo and Europe the benchmark U.S. Treasury bond was mostly steady due to a lack of fresh factors.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal's Heard on the Street column said some Mikasa shareholders may be unhappy with Chairman Alfred Blake, who recently decided to sell back to the company 2.2 million of the 6.2 million Mikasa shares he owns. The deal could sock some regular shareholders with a big tax bill.  </p>
<p>The New York Times's Marketplace column said that while the Dow Industrials are near a record high, the stock market is not nearly as healthy as this might indicate. The current recovery is unusual for its narrowness and is being led by big, presumably safe companies, it said.</p>
