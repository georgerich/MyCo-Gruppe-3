<headline>U.S. OPTIONS FOCUS - Newbridge call spread.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1996-08-21</dateline>
<text>
<p>A spike in shares of Newbridge Networks Corp led to heavy call buying but the bulk of the action was a spread in early trading.</p>
<p>The Newbridge specialist on the Pacific Stock Exchange said an investor sold the September 50/55 call spread at 3-1/8 3,000 times.</p>
<p>By Wednesday afternoon, the September 50 call had traded nearly 5,000 contracts and was up 4-1/8 at 7-1/2. The September 55 call had traded about 4,200 contracts and was ahead 2-3/8 at four.  </p>
<p>Over the last few days, the Newbridge calls had been relatively active and the specialist said an investor had sold about 3,000 of the September 55 calls.</p>
<p>&quot;He was long the September 50s from about a month and a half ago and sold the 55s against it,&quot; he said. &quot;Today he came in and sold the spread.&quot;</p>
<p>The specialist added that Newbridge options had been active earlier in the week as investors speculated on the company's first quarter earnings, which were released on Tuesday.  </p>
<p>The earnings led some analysts to raise 1997 and 1998 earnings per share estimates. J.P. Morgan analyst William Rabin also upgraded his rating to buy from market performer.</p>
<p>In afternoon trading in the U.S., Newbridge was up 7-3/4 at 57-3/4 on 3.47 million shares.</p>
<p>In other trading, calls with longer maturities on shares of Telefonos de Mexico SA de CV (Telmex) were active on the CBOE and the American Stock Exchange despite lacklustre stock action.</p>
<p>Telmex shares were up 1/4 at 33-5/8 in afternoon trading on heavy turnover of 3.3 million shares.  </p>
<p>On the CBOE, the Telmex October 30 call traded 3,175 contracts. It was up 3/8 at 4-1/4. The November 35 call, which was up 1/4 at 1-3/8, traded 2,630 contracts.</p>
<p>Coll volume in Telmex options was relatively heavy through the January series, particularly at the 30 and 35 strikes.</p>
<p>In the September series, the 35 call traded 3,000 contracts on the CBOE and nearly 3,300 on the American Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Telmex put option volume was nominal, led by the January 30 put, which traded 462 contracts on the CBOE.  </p>
<p>Trading in options on shares of Philip Morris Cos Inc continued brisk as the stock declined after Michigan became the 13th state, and the third in two days, to name the company with other tobacco firms in a tobacco liability lawsuit. Arizona and Kansas filed suits on Tuesday.</p>
<p>In afternoon trading, Philip Morris shares were off 2-3/4 at 88-3/4 on heavy volume of 4.87 million shares.</p>
<p>Options investors continued to play both sides of the stock, with put and call activity heavy.</p>
