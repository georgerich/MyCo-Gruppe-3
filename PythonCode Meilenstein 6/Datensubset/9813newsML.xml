<p>One adult was killed and 19 children injured when an explosion ripped through a primary school in the north-east of the Netherlands on Thursday, police said.</p>
<p>A police spokesman said around 100 children, between six and 12, were in the shool in the town of emmeloord at the time of the blast, thought to be linked to repair work on the building's central heating system. None was seriously injured.</p>
<p>The explosion caused widespread damage to the school building, which was likely to be closed for the near future.</p>
<p>&quot;The building is flattened, it looks like it's been hit by a bomb,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>The woman killed in the blast was an administrative worker at the school. One other adult, the mechanic inspecting the central heating, was seriously injured.</p>
