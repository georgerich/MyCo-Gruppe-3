<p>Plastics and textiles processor Ten Cate NV said on Friday it was mulling measures for its loss-making denim production plant Atlantic Mills in Ireland.</p>
<p>&quot;The problems in Ireland are bigger than last year...A sale is one of the options we are discussing,&quot; chairman Frank Schreve told a first half results news conference.</p>
<p>Ten Cate's other denim production unit, Hellenic Fabrics in Greece, was also in the red but was inherently healthier despite high labour costs, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Hellenic Fabrics buys cotton from farmers close to the plant and its clients are based in southern Europe,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The situation in Ireland was very different as the long distance between Atlantic Mills and its suppliers and customers in South Europe had hurt operations.</p>
<p>&quot;In Ireland we not only have to worry about costs, but we have to take care that turnover doesn't fall too much,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The two units were Ten Cate's only loss-making businesses in the 1996 first half, he added.</p>
<p>In Greece, Ten Cate planned job reductions. Market demand for jeans was overall stable while other garments and fabrics for leisure clothes gained in popularity, Ten Cate said.</p>
