<p>The Air Force combat command said on Wednesday it has cancelled most air operations on Friday for a Safety Day review after four crashes including one of President Bill Clinton's support planes.</p>
<p>The Air Combat Command, which has 980 fighter planes, bombers and other combat planes in the United States, Panama, Iceland and Portugal, said all routine operations have been cancelled for the day.</p>
<p>Although most Air Force cargo planes are not involved in the stand-down, the combat command operates a number of C-130 cargo planes including the Clinton support plane that crashed after take off from Jackson Hole, Wyoming, on Saturday.</p>
<p>All nine people aboard were killed. The plane was carrying a Secret Service communications van from Jackson Hole where the Clintons were on vacation.</p>
<p>&quot;We must step back from the day-to-day pressures of the mission and spend a day identifying and quantifying the risks associated with everything that we do, then devising practical ways to mitigate those risks,&quot; the command's chief, Gen. Richard Hawley, said in a statement.</p>
<p>He said units will spend the day examining every part of their operations including the way they plan missions, brief crews on them and fly them.</p>
