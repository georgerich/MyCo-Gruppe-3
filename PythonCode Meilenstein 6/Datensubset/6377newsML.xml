<p>An 11-year-old Florida boy who blasted his cousin with a shotgun when she teased him and pulled down his pants pleaded guilty to manslaughter on Wednesday and wept when he learned he would not be going home for years.</p>
<p>The child was committed to a residential treatment centre for youth offenders after agreeing to the manslaughter charge and use of a firearm during a felony. Prosecutors said he was one of the youngest people convicted of a killing in Dade County.</p>
<p>The boy, dressed in a blue detention uniform, sobbed when he was told he would be placed in a treatment programme three hours away from his Miami home and would not be allowed to return for several years.</p>
<p>&quot;I know you've had a tough life for an 11-year-old. You've had it rough,&quot; said Dade County Juvenile Court Judge Jerald Bagley. &quot;No 11-year-old should be appearing before me.&quot;</p>
<p>The boy, whose name cannot be publicised, killed his 9-year-old cousin, Khadejah Bolden, in May with a shotgun he found in his home, investigators said. The girl's grandfather, John Bolden, was charged with culpable negligence for allegedly leaving the loaded weapon within the boy's reach.</p>
<p>The child was arrested on a charge of second degree murder and prosecutors gave him a choice of pleading guilty to the lesser charge of manslaughter or being tried as an adult on the murder charge.</p>
<p>In a 30-minute hearing, Bagley outlined his options to the boy before accepting the plea agreement.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you understand that when you plead guilty to these charges, you give up your right to what we call a trial? You give up your right to an appeal, do you understand that?&quot; Bagley questioned the child.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; the boy replied in a small voice.</p>
<p>Public defender Marie Osborne said the boy came from a broken home and was taken from his addict mother when he was a baby. The mother died and he was placed in the care of an aunt and uncle.</p>
<p>The aunt, Mary Bolden, told the court the boy had been &quot;badgered&quot; into accepting the plea deal.</p>
<p>In the treatment programme, the boy will be educated, given psychological counselling and character training based on honesty and responsibility, authorities said.</p>
<p>The court has jurisdiction over the child until he is 19, but the length of his stay in the programme was uncertain and would be decided by meetings with counsellors and lawyers.</p>
<p>Osborne said the boy loved his cousin and was &quot;sincerely repentent&quot; for the killing.</p>
