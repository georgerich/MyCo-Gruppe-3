<p>Blue-chip stocks bounded higher Tuesday as the Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates unchanged removed a possible roadblock to the market's continued rally.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 21.82 points at 5,721.26, putting the blue-chip index within a stone's throw of its record closing high of 5,778.00 set on May 22.</p>
<p>In the broader market, advancing issues led declines 1,230 to 1,068 on moderate volume of 334 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>The central bank's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee ended its meeting in early afternoon and kept interest rates unchanged, allowing Wall Street to hurdle any lingering fears of a surprise increase.</p>
<p>&quot;It was as expected. If we can neutralise the interest rate factor here, prices can go higher,&quot; said Richard Cripps, chief market strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker.</p>
<p>The Fed had been expected to hold interest rates steady amid signs the economy was slowing after strong second quarter growth without inflation heating up.</p>
<p>But investors still preferred to hold back until the policy makers announced that they were keeping short term rates unchanged.</p>
<p>The independent Fed also sought to stay out of the line of political fire in the approach to the Nov. 5 presidential and congressional elections.</p>
<p>After growing at its fastest pace in two years in the second quarter, the economy looks to have slowed recently as the housing market has weakened and retail sales have stalled.</p>
<p>Blue-chips actually pared their gains shortly after the Fed news.</p>
<p>&quot;For a few seconds it looked like the buy the rumour, sell the fact. But then the Dow came back up and it's hard to find any indices doing anything spectacular,&quot; said Joseph Barthel, chief investment strategist at Fahnestock &amp; Co.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a Dow-inspired rally and in some ways because of the liquidity factor, visibility and safety,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, weakness in high-technology stocks pressured the tech-studded Nasdaq Composite index, which closed down 6.24 points at 1,124.67.</p>
<p>Tobacco stocks were mostly higher, despite news that Kansas became the 11th state and Arizona the 12th to sue the tobacco industry to recover Medicaid costs of smokers. Philip Morris rose 1-5/8 to 91-1/2, RJR Nabisco slipped 1/4 to 26-1/2, smokeless tobacco maker UST rose 1/8 to 31-3/4, Loews added 1/4 to 77-7/8.</p>
<p>HBO &amp; Co., a maker of software for the medical industry, slumped 5-1/4 to 56-1/2 after a brokerage house downgraded its opinion of the company's performance.</p>
<p>Griffin Gaming soared 7-1/8 to 19-3/8 on news of its merger with Sun International Hotels. Sun International fell 3-5/8 to 48-1/8.</p>
<p>Tylan General rose 2-7/8 to 13-1/8. The company said it is putting itself up for sale and added that it has already received some inquiries from potential buyers.</p>
<p>First Data fell 3-1/2 to 77-3/8. Morgan Stanley trimmed its 1996 and 1997 earnings estimates for the firm.</p>
<p>Among technology issues, Cisco Systems lost 1 to 55, 3Com lost 1-15/16 to 43 and Intel was off 1-1/4 to 79-1/2.</p>
<p>The Standard &amp; Poor's composite index of 500 stocks fell 0.89 to 665.69. The American Stock Exchange index rose 1.69 to 559.29.</p>
<p>The NYSE Composite index of all listed common stocks fell 0.03 to 356.61. The average share was unchanged.</p>
<p>The Wilshire Associates Equity Index -- the market value of NYSE, American and Nasdaq issues -- was 6,504.569 down 7.949 or 0.12 percent.</p>
