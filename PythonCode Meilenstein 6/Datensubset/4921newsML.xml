<p>Yves Michot, the new chairman of France's state-owned aerospace group SNI Aerospatiale, expects the planned merger with combat plane maker Dassault Aviation could take place by mid-1997.</p>
<p>Business daily La Tribune Defosses in an interview with Michot quoted him as saying, &quot;The new company will start life at by mid-1997 at the earliest, optimistically speaking, by the next Le Bourget (Paris) air show.&quot;</p>
<p>The show, which has been Michot's responsibility up to now, is due to be held next June and is a major date in the world industry calendar.  </p>
<p>The government has asked for the Dassault merger to be agreed by January 1, 1997 but Michot thought legal formalities, such as the 45-day merger notice period, shareholder meetings and parliamentary and Privatisation Commission hearings, would take three to five months before the deal is completed.</p>
<p>Michot also wants to push ahead with planned missile and satellite joint ventures with Daimler-Benz Aerospace AG (Dasa), which have lost momentum recently. A meeting with Dasa chairman Manfred Bischoff in September should clarify the situation, the newspaper report said.</p>
<p>Cuts in the French and German defence budgets have weighed on these projects.</p>
<p>Michot is determined that a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on the conversion of Airbus Industrie from a partnership into a joint stock company should be completed by the end of this year, the newspaper reported.</p>
<p>The MOU should set out the precise tasks for each of the four partners -- Aerospatiale, British Aerospace Plc, Dasa and Casa of Spain, he said.  </p>
<p>Michot believed that France has played a major role in the Airbus conversion, contrary to conventional wisdom, and he wanted to keep up speed on the project, the report said.</p>
<p>The government named Michot as Aerospatiale chairman on August 7, after it moved his predecessor, Louis Gallois, to head the state-owned SNCF rail operator on July 24. Michot was previously managing director at Aerospatiale.</p>
