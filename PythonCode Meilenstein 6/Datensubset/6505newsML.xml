<p>Austrian narcotics officials arrested a husband and wife suspected of smuggling 200 kg (440 lb) of heroin across Europe over the past three years, police said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The two suspects, who have Austrian citizenship but originally came from Yugoslavia, were arrested with an alleged courier in Vienna on July 7, a police spokesman said.</p>
<p>It was not immediately clear why news of the arrests was not released until Wednesday.</p>
<p>Police seized 20 kg (44 lb) of heroin worth an estimated $4.5 million.</p>
<p>&quot;We were able to prove that the group smuggled a total of 193 kg (424 lb) of heroin over the past three years,&quot; a police statement said. &quot;The bulk of the narcotics originated in Turkey and were transported via the Balkan route to Hungary, and passed on to Italy via Budapest and Vienna.&quot;</p>
<p>Police identified the three only as husband Milaim I., 48, wife Katarina I., 45, and the alleged courier as Bogosav T., 49.</p>
