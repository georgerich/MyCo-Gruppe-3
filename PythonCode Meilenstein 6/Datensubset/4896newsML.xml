<p>Following are some of the leading stories in Norwegian papers this morning:</p>
<p>AFTENPOSTEN</p>
<p>- During the last six months 33 foreign insurance companies have formally applied to set up business in Norway under the European Economic Area agreement. The Norwegian organization for insurers says it is not worried about possible competition from foreign companies. Except for Swedish-owned Vesta, the foreign companies are practically non-existent in the private market.</p>
<p>- Norwegian salmon producers want support from parliament against British accusations of dumping. Today a delegation of senior civil servants is meeting the EU Commission in Brussels to discuss the accusations that Norway subsidises production.</p>
<p>DAGENS NAERINGSLIV</p>
<p>- The agrarian-based Centre Party wants to postpone a debate in parliament on a new housing tax, saying it should be seen in a wider context. Discussions have been going on since the ruling Labour Party suggested to alter current housing taxes earlier this year.</p>
<p>- Over 50 Norwegian municipalities have offered land for the Coca-Cola Company's new plant.</p>
