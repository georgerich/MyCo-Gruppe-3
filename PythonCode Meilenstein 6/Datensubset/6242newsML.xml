<p>Burma's military government has sentenced a total of 11 democracy activists to seven-year prison terms, sources in Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The military government never announces sentences imposed on dissidents but reports that three activists had been sentenced to prison terms, including Suu Kyi's personal assistant Win Htein, filtered out earlier this week.</p>
<p>The NLD sources said on Wednesday that eight other activists were sentenced to prison terms at the same time.</p>
<p>As well as Win Htein, the 11 comprised one Buddhist monk, a woman and eight other men.</p>
<p>&quot;There were a total of 11 sentenced,&quot; an NLD source at Suu Kyi's house told Reuters. The source said all 11 were sentenced last week and were being held at Insein prison.</p>
<p>Win Htein and two of the others NLD members were charged with &quot;taking part in a video conspiracy fabricating the poor situation of the farmers&quot;, NLD sources said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Apart from Win Htein the names of the others were not immediately available nor was it known under what laws they were sentenced, but NLD sources said it was likely under a sweeping Emergency Powers Act.</p>
<p>&quot;They say they violated section 5G. If they want to act mean it's always 5G,&quot; the NLD official at Suu Kyi's house said.</p>
<p>The 11 were among more than 250 NLD members arrested by the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) in a crackdown on democracy politicians ahead of a May 26 party congress at Suu Kyi's house.</p>
<p>Aye Win, a relative and personal assistant to NLD leader Suu Kyi, was arrested in the crackdown. His family told Reuters on Tuesday he had not yet been sentenced.</p>
<p>Most of the NLD politicians arrested by the SLORC were released after the May 26-28 party meeting took place. The government said at the time the arrests were made to prevent anarchy arising as a result of the meeting.</p>
