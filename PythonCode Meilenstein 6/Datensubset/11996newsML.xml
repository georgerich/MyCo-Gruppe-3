<p>The Belgian central bank released the following indices based on its monthly survey of three key economic sectors -</p>
<p>    BELGIAN LEADING INDICATOR    July	  June</p>
<p>    Overall			    - 7.7	 -12.1</p>
<p>    Manufacturing		    -10.8	 -14.5</p>
<p>    Trade				+ 3.8	 - 6.3</p>
<p>    Building			   - 5.3	 - 7.0</p>
<p>NOTE - The leading index is based on central bank surveys of manufacturing, construction and retailing and calculated on the basis of the difference between positive and negative answers to the bank's questions.</p>
<p>It is slightly positive at the top of an economic cycle, while it is strongly negative at the depth of a recession.</p>
<p>NOTE - In the statement the central bank said the strong rise in the July indicator confirmed the upward trend seen since the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>There were improvements in January and February before a fall in March, but since then the index has risen.</p>
<p>The central bank said there were improvements in all sectors.</p>
<p>It warned the increases should be treated with caution in view of the seasonally lower number of responses in the survey.</p>
