<p>High sulphur fuel oil prices were expected to dip as crude slipped, traders said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Prices of 180-cst supplies were bid/asked at $103/$105 on Tuesday.</p>
<p>A MidEast trader said he was still a keen buyer for September barrels but remained uncertain on where he would place his bid.</p>
<p>Most traders expected prices to be a shade softer from Tuesday's quotes.</p>
<p>A major said the market in North Asia is soft. He said total availabilities from South Korea and Japan of around 150,000 tonnes to 200,000 tonnes were sufficient to meet demand from China.</p>
<p>But he said fundamentals in Singapore remained healthy if the same MidEast trader who won the recent Thailand tender to buy August barrels continued to place strong bids.</p>
<p>Traders said the trader is expected to be pricing in his cargoes to Thailand until August 28.</p>
<p>Traders also confirmed that the arbitrage from Mediterranean is closed.</p>
