<p>Palm oil prices held steady through out Friday on the European vegetable oil market following news that China has set a palm oil import quota.</p>
<p>On Thursday Malaysian Primary Industries Minister Lim Keng Yaik said China had approved imports of 1.3 million tonnes of palm oil between August 1996 and March 1997.</p>
<p>Lim said he believed 80 percent of palm oil would come from Malaysia with Indonesia making up the balance.</p>
<p>Prices in the Far East were also supported by rumours that India was seeking 250,000 tonnes of palm oil for Sep/Oct shipment.  </p>
<p>But India's State Trading Corporation (STC) branch manager in Singapore denied the STC was in the market for this amount of palm oil, while Far East traders said the talk was focusing on Indian buyers as a whole, not just the STC.</p>
<p>In Europe traders said they had not come across the rumours.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a load of rubbish, just someone trying to bull the market for their own reasons, but all they will do is frighten China off with even higher prices,&quot; said one.</p>
<p>Traders said China is already unlikely to rush in and buy palm oil because the prices is already too high when compared with soft oils.  </p>
<p>Others said they did not see the Chinese move as significant.</p>
<p>&quot;Even if China takes the lot, which is unlikely in the current market, 1.3 million tonnes isn't a great deal spread over eight months,&quot; said one.</p>
<p>At the end of a quiet session crude palm oil cif Europe was $15 to $20 up after Aug traded at $545 and $550, Sep at $545 and $547.50 and Nov/Dec at $545 a tonne cif.</p>
<p>Refined palm oil finished around $15 higher.</p>
<p>In other markets, lauric oils were tradeless and closed unchanged to $15 up.</p>
<p>Soft oils finished with soy oil one guilder up to 0.50 guilders down and rape oil 0.50 to one guilder lower.</p>
<p>Traders expect a quiet start to next week with UK players on holiday on Monday August 26, but participants in the Netherlands will be working normally.</p>
