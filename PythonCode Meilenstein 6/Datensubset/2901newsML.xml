<p>The Dow industrials bounded higher as the Federal Reserve voted to keep monetary policy unchanged, allowing Wall Street to hurdle any lingering fears of a surprise tightening.</p>
<p>&quot;It was as expected. If we can neutralize the interest-rate factor here, prices can go higher,&quot; said Richard Cripps, chief market strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker. &quot;The last two weeks of August are the sweet spot for the market -- no corporate reports and no major economic releases.&quot;  The Dow industrials rose 22 to about 5722.  </p>
<p>The blue chip index is within a stone's throw of the record close of 5778.00 on May 22.</p>
<p>Weakness in high-technology issues pressured the tech-studded Nasdaq Composite, off six to about 1125. But the broader market was firmer with gainers beating losers 6-5 on still paltry NYSE volume of about 336 million shares.</p>
<p>The long bond fell 2/32 to yield 6.80 percent after news the Fed opted to hold rates steady amid signs the economy is cooling off without inflation heating up. The decision kept the independent Fed out of the line of political fire in the runup to the Nov 5 presidential and congressional elections.  </p>
<p>U.S. blue chips momentarily pared gains after the Fed news on a sell-program that wiped 12 points off the Dow, according to Birinyi Associates Inc.</p>
<p>&quot;For a few seconds it looked like 'buy the rumor, sell the fact.' But then the Dow came back up and it's hard to find any index doing anything spectacular,&quot; said Joseph Barthel, chief investment strategist at Fahnestock &amp; Co.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a Dow-inspired rally...because of the liquidity factor, visibility and safety,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>As for individual sectors, Legg Mason's Cripps noted some further strength in oils and weaker software service providers.  </p>
<p>Texaco added 5/8 to 89-3/4 and Exxon rose 1/4 to 83-3/4.</p>
<p>HBO &amp; Co slumped 5-1/4 to 56-1/2 after Morgan Keegan started coverage of the stock with an underperform rating, a tarder said. The analyst and HBO officials were unavailable.</p>
<p>First Data fell 3-1/2 to 77-3/8. Morgan Stanley trimmed 1996 and 1997 estimates but maintained its outperform.</p>
<p>Tobacco stocks were mostly higher as Kansas and Arizona joined other states and municipalities seeking damages from the tobacco industry. Philip Morris added 1-5/8 to 91-1/2, RJR Nabisco slipped 1/4 to 26-1/2, smokeless tobacco maker UST rose 1/8 to 31-3/4, Loews added 1/4 to 77-7/8.  </p>
<p>Capstar Hotel, a Washington, D.C.-based company that invests in and manages hotels nationwide, was unchanged at 18 in its Wall Street debut.</p>
<p>Griffin Gaming soared 7-1/8 to 19-3/8 after it agreed to merge with Sun International Hotels in a stock deal. Sun International fell 3-5/8 to 48-1/8. Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette downgraded Sun to outperform from buy.</p>
<p>Tylan General rose 2-7/8 to 13-1/8 after news it is exploring the possible sale of the company and added it has already received some inquiries from potential buyers.  </p>
<p>Among technology issues, Cisco Systems lost one to 55, 3Com lost 1-15/16 to 43 and Intel was off 1-1/4 to 79-1/2.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq Composite fell 6.24 to 1124.67.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 index fell 0.89 to 665.69.</p>
