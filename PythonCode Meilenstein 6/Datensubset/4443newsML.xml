<p>---------------- VIEWS FROM THE MARKET - Aug 20 ---------------</p>
<p>+ Imminent chart breakout from 730p should ensure SmithKline Beecham shares can then move to 850p, technical analysts said.</p>
<p>+ Positive aspects for the shares include a robust stock market and improving relative strength against the All-Share index. Deviation between the shares 200 and 25 day moving averages is beginning to widen as the short-term average chases the shares higher.  </p>
<p>Shares in pharmaceuticals group SmithKline Beecham are close to chart breakout at 730p and if this occurs it paves the way for a further advance, technical analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Once 730p is broken, the way should be open for a move to at least 850p (long-term),&quot; said David Charters, managing director at Investment Research of Cambridge Ltd.</p>
<p>By 0800 GMT, SmithKline Beecham shares were up 3p to 720p.</p>
<p>&quot;The shares have been taking a breather throughout most of this year and have consistently backed away from the 730p level,&quot; Charters added.  </p>
<p>After stumbling to 630p in April from a peak at 725p in February the shares have made three previous attempts to make a break to the upside but this latest attempt may be successful.</p>
<p>One encouraging sign is that SmithKline Beecham shares have made a series of higher lows since April.</p>
<p>&quot;They are winding themselves up for another attack and the relative strength (against the All-Share index) looks rather better this time,&quot; said Charters.</p>
<p>During this build-up, the deviation between the 200 and 25 day moving averages has narrowed to less than one percent in July from from about 14 percent in February.  </p>
<p>If the share price presses higher, the deviation between the moving averages will widen as the 25 day average seeks to follow the shares up and pulls away from the 200 day average.</p>
<p>&quot;SmithKline Beecham is a classic growth share which (and) with the present (positive) market background, (it) is unlikely to languish for very much longer,&quot; said Charters.</p>
