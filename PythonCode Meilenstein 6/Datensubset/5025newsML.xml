<p>Cross border investment increased in 1996 over 1995, with double-digit growth rates in both Europe and the United States, a report on global equity investment flows from fund data company Technimetrics shows.</p>
<p>Total U.S. holdings abroad climbed to 17.6 percent during Q1 1996, after a 0.9 percent rise in Q4 1995, while international equity investment held by European institutions rose 12.5 percent in Q1, up from an increase of just 5.8 percent the previous quarter.</p>
<p>Europe was by far the biggest destination for U.S. institutional investment in non-U.S. equities, attracting some $217 billion (52.7 percent) at end-March 1996 against $181 billion at end-December 1995.</p>
<p>Asia Pacific was the next most attractive area (24.8 percent of international holdings), followed by Canada and Latin America and all showed increased investment over the last quarter.</p>
<p>Technimetrics said U.S. investors are also beginning to &quot;show measurable interest&quot; in the developing markets of eastern Europe, starting with Russia's Lukoil ADR in January and increased holdings in Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>Latin American holdings are also increasing, especially in Brazil and Mexico, where U.S. holdings are now higher than they were in December 1994 just before Mexico's financial crisis.</p>
<p>Latin American equities represent 7.3 percent of U.S. international investment, up from 6.4 percent a year ago.</p>
<p>European investors continued their preference for non-domestic European investments, which grew by nine percent during the quarter. They now make up 43.6 percent of European cross-border investment, from 38.4 percent a year ago.</p>
<p>&quot;The increase came at the expanse of equities in Asia-Pacific and the U.S. and Canada,&quot; Technimetrics said.</p>
<p>European investors also like the look of eastern European markets but have backed away from Latin American stocks during the quarter, with holdings flat compared with Q4 1995.</p>
<p>European Latin American equity holdings are still higher (2.3 percent) than they were a year ago (two percent).</p>
