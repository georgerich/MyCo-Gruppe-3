<p>Sydney Kings guard Shane Heal has joined the Minnesota Timberwolves in the NBA on a three-year contract worth a reported AS1.5 million.</p>
<p>Heal, a three-point specialist, said the prospect of playing in the best league in the world was beyond his expectations.</p>
<p>During the NBA off-season he would return to Australia to help the Kings in a &quot;non-playing capacity&quot;, Heal said.</p>
<p>Heal told reporters he would wear the number 10 singlet when playing in the U.S. in honour of his friend and Australia teammate Andrew Gaze.</p>
<p>The Kings released Heal from the final two years of his three-year contract but will have first choice on the player when he is finished with the NBA, The Sydney Morning Herald newspaper reported on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Heal becomes only the third Australian to play in the NBA behind Luc Longley of the Chicago Bulls and Gaze, who spent a brief time with the Washington Bullets two years ago.</p>
