<p>Argentine Economy Minister Roque Fernandez said Friday he was confident ruling Peronist Party legislators would help pass his controversial austerity package in early October.</p>
<p>&quot;Peronism is a big, opinionated party,&quot; he told local radio, referring to criticism of his belt-tightening measures from within party ranks.</p>
<p>&quot;But there is strong support. We will have (the austerity package) in the first week of October,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Fernandez went on to blame congressional reluctance to endorse his unpopular measures -- which include tax hikes and raising the retirement age for women to 65 from 60 -- on opposition forces.</p>
<p>&quot;The opposition not only does not come up with alternative proposals, but is also trying to prevent this proposal from being passed quickly,&quot; Fernandez said.</p>
<p>Fears that the package may suffer delays or severe alterations in Congress have been taking a toll on Argentine stocks and bonds all week. Unions are also planning to go on strike in September against the government's austerity plans.</p>
