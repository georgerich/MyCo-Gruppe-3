<headline>British man faces trial in Sweden after Nazi demo.</headline>

<p>A British man arrested during a neo-Nazi demonstration in southern Sweden, allegedly armed with a homemade bomb, was remanded in custody on Tuesday and will face trial in two weeks time, a police spokesman said.</p>
<p>The 34-year-old man, born in London but currently of no fixed address, was one of seven people arrested on Saturday when a demonstration in Trollhattan erupted into violent clashes between neo-Nazis and anti-racist groups.</p>
<p>Contrary to an earlier police statement, the man was a supporter of the anti-racist group, not the neo-Nazis.</p>
<p>Police spokesman Sergeant Stig Andersson told Reuters that the British man appeared before Trollhattan court on Tuesday, charged with possessing a weapon with intent to harm.</p>
<p>He was remanded in custody.</p>
<p>Andersson said the man, whose name cannot be released under Swedish law, would face trial in nearby Uddevalla in about two weeks' time.</p>
<p>He said the other six people arrested had been released.</p>
<p>The demonstration was held to mark the anniversary of the death of Adolf Hitler's right-hand man, Rudolf Hess.</p>
<p>Around 600 police, some on horseback, were called in to separate the two groups after fighting broke out.</p>
<p>Some of the demonstrators had travelled from Norway, Denmark, Britain and Germany for the event.</p>
<p>One person, a skinhead, needed hospital treatment after being hit on the head by a rock during the brawl.</p>
<p>Some policemen were slightly hurt in the melee and several demonstrators were bitten by police dogs but no other injuries were reported.</p>
