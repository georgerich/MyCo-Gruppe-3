<p>Singapore oil product prices were mixed on Friday with gas oil traders nervous that Indian Oil Corp (IOC) might take less than expected volumes in its October tender, traders said.</p>
<p>Late in the day the market projected India might take as low as 400,000-450,000 tonnes of gas oil, down from 600,000-700,000 tonnes and much lower than initial projections of up to one million tonnes. Market jitters were translated into lower levels in both paper and physical gas oil. September paper was earlier offered at $25.90 but later fell to be traded at $25.55, $25.40 $25.35. Physical gas oil also bids fell.  </p>
<p>A trader bid 150,000 barrels for September 18-22 at $24.90, and another bid at $25.30 for 200,000 barrels lifting September 16-20. Thursday's bids were $25.45-$25.50. Jet fuel firmed with 100,000 barrels traded at 10 cents a barrel over Singapore quotes lifting early September fob Singapore. A late September cargo of 120,000 barrels was bid as at $29.30 fob. On Thursday a Singapore trader sold to a US trader at $28.50 and a Japanese refiner sold to a Japanese trader at $28.80. Traders said a Japanese refiner has bought term kerosene for winter, but spot activities remained thin. Japanese firms were expected to step up kerosene imports soon for winter due to low domestic stocks.  </p>
<p>Naphtha firmed on higher crudes with September paper called at $19.90-20.05 per barrel, about 40 cents over the previous close. Gasoline remained range bound with a 50,000 barrel 95 ron unl cargo traded at $21.50. A Thai refiner sold a 250,000 barrel 92 ron unl cargo at 35 cents below the Singapore quotes on a free-on-board Rayong basis, loading on Sep 18-22. Sources report that Thailand may have another September export spot cargo soon.</p>
<p>Fuel oil rallied, fulled by a strong paper market which gained $3 a tonne from Thursday along with strong crudes. A bid for 180-cst for first-half September was seen at $104.25 up nearly $1 from Thursday. --SINGAPORE NEWSROOM (+65-8703084)</p>
