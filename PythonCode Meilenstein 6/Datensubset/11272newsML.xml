<p>China on Friday proclaimed the sincerity of its desire for direct air and sea links with Taiwan and said conditions for such contacts were improving.</p>
<p>China on Tuesday unilaterally introduced rules governing direct shipping links with Taiwan, raising hopes of an end to a decades-old ban on such contacts by the island which Beijing regards as a renegade province.</p>
<p>&quot;The promulgation of these documents ... fully shows the mainland's sincerity in this regard,&quot; the official Xinhua news agency said.</p>
<p>Taiwan has banned direct shipping, air and mail links with the communist mainland since its Nationalist government fled to the island in 1949 after a civil war and sees them as its last bargaining chip in dealing with Beijing.</p>
<p>&quot;Conditions are gradually improving for realising direct links across the strait,&quot; Xinhua said.</p>
<p>Relations between the two sides plummeted after Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui infuriated Beijing with a visit to the United States in May 1995.</p>
<p>Taiwanese investors, who have poured more than $20 billion into China, are eager for direct transport links. Xinhua said the new rules would gain backing from Taiwan's shipping industry.</p>
<p>&quot;This will surely win support from the people of both sides, and also shipping entrepreneurs of Taiwan,&quot; Xinhua said.</p>
