<headline>Med/W African crude firm as sales, margins improve.</headline>

<p>Spot crudes in the Mediterranean and West Africa were slightly firmer on Thursday after healthy demand cleared several cargoes earlier in the week and margins picked themselves off the floor, traders said.</p>
<p>In the Mediterranean, Russian Urals was still well supplied but a couple of cents firmer at around Dated Brent -80/85 cents cif. Traders questioned a reported deal on Wednesday at Dated Brent -75 cents for a cargo loading August 23-25.</p>
<p>It was sold to a trader and destined for Romania, which took three cargoes but there was no indication of price levels.</p>
<p>One European refinery buyer said that although Urals was well supplied for August and early September loadings, sellers were relaxed after several cargoes moved into northwest Europe and cargoes were shuffled around among traders in the Med.</p>
<p>Three Urals cargoes moved on Wednesday at prices ranging from Dated Brent -32 cents to Dated -39 cents basis cif NWE.</p>
<p>One refinery trader said the Urals market was supported partly by the absence of Iranian grades and also by one trader having to cover a short position.</p>
<p>&quot;That is perhaps the reason why Urals is moving up. Margins in the north are as awful as they are all over Europe,&quot; the trader said.</p>
<p>West African markets were quiet but firmer on Thursday after a flurry of deals earlier in the week, traders said.</p>
<p>Nigerian Bonny Light was offered at Dated Brent +54 cents after second and third decade barrels of the same grade fetched +51/+52 cents on Wednesday to U.S. and European refiners.</p>
<p>Other Wednesday deals to emerge included the sale of a cargo of Forcados due to co-load with a Qua Iboe on a VLCC to a U.S. Gulf refiner. A parcel of Brass River was also sold on a delivered basis into Cameroon, traders said.</p>
<p>But with three or four cargoes of Forcados, a similar number of Escravos and a couple each of Bonny Light and Qua Iboe still unsold in September, traders said premiums were unlikely to rally much further.</p>
