<p>Sri Lanka has begun arresting army deserters who did not return to their camps despite a two-month government amnesty, army spokesman Brigadier Sarath Munasinghe said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Since the amnesty lapsed at the end of last month, the military has arrested 311 soldiers, including two officers, Munasinghe told a news conference.</p>
<p>They are among the 15,000 who deserted the army during the past five years as fighting escalated against separatist Tamil guerrillas.</p>
<p>&quot;But 4,206 deserters responded to the pardon and have returned to their duty stations,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The army, strapped for troops to fight the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), has offered amnesties in the past, but it is the first time it has publicised arrests.</p>
<p>Military sources said the army's recruitment campaign gathered momentum soon after troops captured the rebels' northern Jaffna peninsula stronghold in a series of well publicised offensives that ended last April.</p>
<p>But the army suffered its worst setback in the 13-year ethnic war last month when rebels overran a key army camp in the island's northeast, killing or capturing the camp's 1,400 soldiers.</p>
<p>The Tigers, fighting for independence in the north and east, are known to be ferocious fighters and carry a cyanide capsule in a string around their necks to prevent being captured alive.</p>
<p>Munasinghe said 15,000 deserters in five years was not unusual for an army fighting a guerrilla war.</p>
<p>The government last year said more than 50,000 people have died in the war.</p>
