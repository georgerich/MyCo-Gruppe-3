<p>MADRID, Aug 20 (Reuter) 1510 GMT - Madrid stocks managed to increase a slight gain at the close on Tuesday although trade was thin as the market kept a wary eye on the U.S. Fed's open market committee.</p>
<p>The Fed is expected to leave rates unchanged. But regardless of its decision the prospect of Thursday's Bundesbank meeting should make sure volumes remain minimal for the next two days, with trading limited to a narrow range. * General index up 0.77 points, 0.22 percent, to 354.03 * Ibex up 9.97 points, 0.25 percent, to 4,022.23 * BBV up 70 pesetas to 5,230 after positive press reports on its Latin American investments, traders said.  </p>
<p>Food retailer Pryca saw a sharp rise of 80 pesetas to 3,025 in busy trade amid talk that first half results, due to be announced in September, will be particularly healthy dealers said.</p>
<p>Except for selected stocks trade was dull, with the extreme price swings characteristic of thin volume.</p>
<p>The tone is expected to remain similar at least until after the UK bank holiday on August 26, dealers said.</p>
<p>Turnover totalled around 21 billion pesetas.</p>
