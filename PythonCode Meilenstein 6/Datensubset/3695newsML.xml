<p>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday named David Janssen as the county's new chief administrative officer, a county spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>Janssen, a former chief administrative officer of San Diego County, will assume the post on Monday.</p>
<p>His appointment was approved by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors on a vote of 5-to-0, spokeswoman Judy Hammond said.  </p>
<p>Janssen fills a post vacated by Sally Reed, who resigned in May to become head of California's Department of Motor Vehicles.</p>
<p>County supervisors had named Sandra Davis, Reed's chief deputy, as interim chief administrative officer until a replacement was found.</p>
<p>Janssen served as San Diego County's chief administrative officer from 1992 to 1996. Before that, he served as the county's assistant administrative officer.</p>
